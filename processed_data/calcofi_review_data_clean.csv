Conception",34.46,"Approximate","Online search",-120.49,"Approximate","Online search",NA,1957,"Exact","October","Exact",NA,NA,"warm water",34.5,"Google Maps","1960","Figure 118 shows the distribution of the cool water species of the pair, Dolioletta gegenbauri, along our coast. It may be seen that its distribution extends rather far south, especially near the coast. In the period since October 1950, when the fishing depth of our net hauls was deepened from 70 to 140 meters, this has been a rather typical distribution. The distribution of the other species, Doliolum denticulatum, is shown in figure 119. It may be seen that this species is the warm water analogue of D. gegenbauri. During the period 1949-1952, D. denticulatum did not occur near shore to the north of the Santa Barbara group of Channel Islands and only rarely north of San Diego. In October 1957, D. gegenbauri appears spottily over the survey area with a rather large group east and south of Guadalupe Island. This might be called a more or less “typical” distribution (Fig. 120). An examination of the distribution of D. denticzclatunt (Fig. 121) however shows a rather marked difference from the “typical” distribution (Fig. 119). It occurred nearshore and north as far as the sampling extended, line 80 off Pt. Conception. In addition to mere occurrence, the maximum numbers were found in the nearshore area around and north of the Santa Barbara group of Channel Islands. The October cruise unfortunately did not sample north of Pt. Conception so I have taken the liberty of superimposing some stations from the November cruise to the north. The fit between the two is rather good at line 80 (Fig. 121). Before leaving the discussion of these two charts it may be of some interest to point out that B. denticulatum is missing from several of the stations where D. gegenbaura occurred far to the south. The distributions of these two species during April 1958 again are unusual. D. denticulatum is found north almost to Monterey in the nearshore area (Fig. 122). A population center is found in the Santa Monica Bay area where usually at this time of year the species is not found. The offshore distribution is not considered unusual for this time of year. D.gegenbauri during April 1958 shows a very patchy distribution, which, to a lesser extent, is seen early in other years (Fig. 123). Samples that have been examined subsequent to the time this chart was prepared indicate the species was also found in patches toward the south. It is my opinion, on the basis of the biological data, that during 1957, sometime after July, the flow of the California Current for some reason was reduced. During this time upwelling must have also been reduced. At the same time these two processes supplying cool water to the area were reduced, a nearshore countercurrent, as indicated by the distribution of D. denticzdatzcm, developed carrying warm water and its contained populations to the north.

It may be seen that its distribution extends rather far south, especially near the coast. In the period since October 1950, when the fishing depth of our net hauls was deepened from 70 to 140 meters, this has been a rather typical distribution. The distribution of the other species, Doliolum denticulatum, is shown in figure 119. It may be seen that this species is the warm water analogue of D. gegenbauri. During the period 1949-1952, D. denticulatum did not occur near shore to the north of the Santa Barbara group of Channel Islands and only rarely north of San Diego. In October 1957, D. gegenbauri appears spottily over the survey area with a rather large group east and south of Guadalupe Island. This might be called a more or less “typical” distribution (Fig. 120). An examination of the distribution of D. denticzclatunt (Fig. 121) however shows a rather marked difference from the “typical” distribution (Fig. 119). It occurred nearshore and north as far as the sampling extended, line 80 off Pt. Conception. In addition to mere occurrence, the maximum numbers were found in the nearshore area around and north of the Santa Barbara group of Channel Islands. The October cruise unfortunately did not sample north of Pt. Conception so I have taken the liberty of superimposing some stations from the November cruise to the north. The fit between the two is rather good at line 80 (Fig. 121). Before leaving the discussion of these two charts it may be of some interest to point out that B. denticulatum is missing from several of the stations where D. gegenbaura occurred far to the south. The distributions of these two species during April 1958 again are unusual. D. denticulatum is found north almost to Monterey in the nearshore area (Fig. 122). A population center is found in the Santa Monica Bay area where usually at this time of year the species is not found. The offshore distribution is not considered unusual for this time of year. D.gegenbauri during April 1958 shows a very patchy distribution, which, to a lesser extent, is seen early in other years (Fig. 123). Samples that have been examined subsequent to the time this chart was prepared indicate the species was also found in patches toward the south. It is my opinion, on the basis of the biological data, that during 1957, sometime after July, the flow of the California Current for some reason was reduced. During this time upwelling must have also been reduced. At the same time these two processes supplying cool water to the area were reduced, a nearshore countercurrent, as indicated by the distribution of D. denticzdatzcm, developed carrying warm water and its contained populations to the north.
