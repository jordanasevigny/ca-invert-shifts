We used barnacles, a relatively well‐studied taxon, to investigate the extent to which modern commercial vessels disperse biofouling species beyond their current known ranges.                                         Location               Vessels predominantly operated in the North Pacific; sampling was conducted in Los Angeles (CA), Portland (OR), Ketchikan (AK) and Apra Harbor (GU).                                         Methods               Barnacles were collected from submerged surfaces of commercial vessel hulls and identified to the lowest taxonomic unit using a combination of taxonomic and molecular phylogenetic techniques. Their known native and non‐native geographical ranges were assessed and compared with the voyage history of the vessels.                                         Results               Forty distinct taxonomic groups of barnacles (22 assigned to species) were detected from 15 vessels. Six of these recognized species have a world‐wide distribution, due to natural and anthropogenic dispersal. Sixteen species were on vessels with voyage routes that extend beyond the barnacles' known distributions, including 12 species sampled outside of their known range.                                         Main conclusions               A diverse suite of barnacle species is in continuous motion globally on commercial vessel hulls, and the potential scale of this transfer is underscored by the documented species richness for ship biofouling and what is known about the global fleet of vessels. We estimate roughly 680,000 separate arrival events per year for barnacle species to US ports distributed on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Genetic methods revealed high richness compared with previous studies, and the real rate is likely to be much higher than this because (1) it is likely that not all species on a vessel were sampled and (2) only a subset of sampled barnacles were successfully sequenced. Our limited knowledge about the total species pool in flux on ship hulls around the globe constrains our ability to analyse and interpret processes affecting species distribution patterns in the Anthropocene.","2016-06","2025-02-21 22:43:57","2025-02-21 22:43:57","2025-02-21 22:43:57","739-750","","6","25","","Global Ecol.

Prey were identified to the lowest taxonomic level and diet composition was analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Of 299 swordfish sampled (74 to 245 cm eye-to-fork length), 292 non-empty stomachs contained remains from 60 prey taxa. Genetic analyses were used to identify prey that could not be identified visually. Diet consisted mainly of cephalopods but also included epipelagic and mesopelagic teleosts. Jumbo squid (               Dosidicus gigas               ) and               Gonatopsis borealis               were the most important prey based on the geometric index of importance. Swordfish diet varied with body size, location and year. Jumbo squid,               Gonatus               spp. and Pacific hake (               Merluccius productus               ) were more important for larger swordfish, reflecting the ability of larger specimens to catch large prey. Jumbo squid,               Gonatus               spp. and market squid (               Doryteuthis opalescens               ) were more important in inshore waters, while               G               .               borealis               and Pacific hake predominated offshore. Jumbo squid was more important in 2007–2010 than in 2011–2014, with Pacific hake being the most important prey item in the latter period. Diet variation by area and year probably reflects differences in swordfish preference, prey availability, prey distribution, and prey abundance. The range expansion of jumbo squid that occurred during the first decade of this century may particularly explain their prominence in swordfish diet during 2007–2010. Some factors (swordfish size, area, time period, sea surface temperature) that may influence dietary variation in swordfish were identified. Standardizing methods could make future studies more comparable for conservation monitoring purposes.","2023-02-16","2025-02-21 22:43:59","2025-02-21 22:43:59","2025-02-21 22:43:59","e0258011","","2","18","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/86UMSM9B/Feeding ecology of broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gl - Preti et al. - 2023.pdf","","","","Medina Guerrero, Antonio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined variability at 15 SNP loci and in mtDNA sequences (COI, 665 bp) in red king crab from 17 localities in the North Pacific. These markers define three geographically distinct evolutionary lineages (SNPs,               F               CT                = 0.054; mtDNA Φ               CT                = 0.222): (i) Okhotsk Sea–Norton Sound–Aleutian Islands, (ii) southeastern Bering Sea–western Gulf of Alaska, and (iii) Southeast Alaska.

Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) indicate postglacial population expansions, presumably from ice‐age refugia. BSPs of sequences simulated under a demographic model defined by late Pleistocene temperatures failed to detect demographic variability before the last glacial maximum. These results sound a note of caution for the interpretation of BSPs. Population fragmentation in the Bering Sea and in Southeast Alaskan waters requires population management on a small geographic scale, and deep evolutionary partitions between the three geographic groups mandate regional conservation measures.","2012-12","2025-02-21 22:44:00","2025-02-21 22:44:00","2025-02-21 22:44:00","820-837","","8","5","","Evolutionary Applications","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/UDEARMIU/Incorporating deep and shallow components of genet - Grant and Cheng - 2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this prediction fails to take into account the greater latitudinal extent of tropical temperatures relative to those at higher latitudes. Here we model the contributions of the broader latitudinal extent of equal‐temperature habitats at low latitudes and the greater annual temperature variation at high latitudes to the range size–latitude relationship, and test whether the latitudinal variation in geographic range size in marine bivalves can be explained by models that account for both annual temperature variation and the steepness of latitudinal thermal gradients.

Methods               We use a null model where geographic ranges are placed on the ocean surface independently of thermal gradients, and a range‐expansion model where the minimum and maximum temperatures encompassed by the geographic range of a species (macroecological thermal ranges) are positively related to annual temperature minima and maxima at the location where the species originated. We compare results with a database containing 40,820 occurrences of 4760 marine bivalve species.

Main conclusions               The poleward trend in latitudinal range size is determined by the nonlinearity of the latitudinal gradient of temperature minima and maxima and less by the latitudinal gradient of the local seasonal range in temperatures. Although tropical species do have narrower macroecological thermal ranges than high‐latitude species, the nearly constant temperatures over wide areas of the tropics allow tropical species to achieve broad latitudinal ranges.","2015-02","2025-02-21 22:44:17","2025-02-21 22:44:17","2025-02-21 22:44:17","157-167","","2","24","","Global Ecology and Biogeography","Nonlinear thermal gradients shape broad‐scale patterns in geographic range size and can reverse <span style=""font-variant","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its native habitat is sub‐boreal northeast Asia, but in the Northern Hemisphere, it is now found on both coasts of North America, and North Atlantic coastlines of Europe. Direct sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome               c               oxidase subunit I gene) was used to compare genetic variation in native and non‐native populations of               C. mutica               . These data were used to investigate the invasion history of               C. mutica               and to test potential source populations in Japan. High diversity (31 haplotypes from 49 individuals), but no phylogeographical structure, was identified in four populations in the putative native range. In contrast, non‐native populations showed reduced genetic diversity (7 haplotypes from 249 individuals) and informative phylogeographical structure. Grouping of               C. mutica               populations into native, east Pacific, and Atlantic groups explained the most among‐region variation (59%). This indicates independent introduction pathways for               C. mutica               to the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America. Two dominant haplotypes were identified in eastern and western Atlantic coastal populations, indicating several dispersal routes within the Atlantic. The analysis indicated that several introductions from multiple sources were likely to be responsible for the observed global distribution of               C. mutica               , but the pathways were least well defined among the Atlantic populations. The four sampled populations of               C. mutica               in Japan could not be identified as the direct source of the non‐native populations examined in this study. The high diversity within the Japan populations indicates that the native range needs to be assessed at a far greater scale, both within and among populations, to accurately assess the source of the global spread of               C. mutica               .","2008-03","2025-02-21 22:44:18","2025-02-21 22:44:18","2025-02-21 22:44:18","1293-1303","","5","17","","Molecular Ecology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consumption of large numbers of relatively small, high calorie prey in both relatively cool (anchovies) and relatively warm, productive conditions (myctophids) is likely necessary to support growth to large body sizes before maturation. When warm, unproductive conditions prevailed in the GOC, only small squid were present and had diets dominated by euphausiids and pteropods, prey with relatively low caloric value. Using a time series of diet data, this work provides unique insights into the response of a midwater forage community to oceanographic variability and the effects of environmental variability on the trophic ecology of an oceanic predator.","2020-04","2025-02-21 22:44:28","2025-02-21 22:44:28","2025-02-21 22:44:28","732-748","","4","65","","Limnology & Oceanography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/J7MEKM4Y/Trophic ecology of Humboldt squid, Dosidicus gi - Portner et al. - 2020.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper provides an overview of the serpulid species found in North America, as part of a broader study of fouling invertebrates focused on NIS (non-indigenous species) in United States coastal ecosystems. Almost 4400 serpulid specimens were examined from selected fouling plates. Fouling plates were deployed in 26 bays and coastal lagoons along the continental coasts of the United States and Hawaiian islands, primarily in bays and lagoons with salinities averaging 20‰ or greater. Twenty-five serpulid species were identified, including four new records for the United States (Ficopomatus uschakovi, Hydroides cf. brachyacantha, H. longispinosa and Protula longiseta), three known NIS, two presumed NIS, three cryptogenic serpulids, and several range extensions. Crucigera websteri extends its northward range from Santa Barbara Island to Humboldt Bay, California; Ficopomatus enigmaticus, first recorded in North America from San Francisco, California in 1920, Rockport, Texas in 1952 and Barnegat Bay, New Jersey in 1980, is now recorded at additional localities on the east coast (Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, Charleston, South Carolina and Indian River, Florida) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Galveston Bay, Texas); F. miamiensis extends its westward range from Louisiana to Texas; F. uschakovi, an Indo-Pacific and Western African species, was recorded formally for the first time from the northern Gulf of Mexico (Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi, Texas) and the east coast of Florida (Jacksonville). Hydroides cf. brachyacantha extends its northward range from Curaҫao to Pensacola Bay, Florida; H. dirampha from Veracruz, Mexico to Corpus Christi, Texas; H. floridana extends its westward range from Louisiana to Texas; H. gracilis extends its northward range from Pacific Grove to San Francisco, California; Salmacina huxleyi from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Rhode Island; and Spirobranchus minutus from Veracruz, Mexico to Pensacola Bay, Florida. The following additional species range extensions are provisional in that they represent only one record or were not found in the most recent surveys (e.g., Hydroides elegans - east coast): H. longispinosa from Marshall Islands to Oahu, Hawaii; Protula balboensis from Florida to Texas; P. longiseta from the Mexican Caribbean to the Indian River, Florida; H. elegans from San Francisco to Humboldt Bay, northern California and on the east coast from the Indian River, Florida, to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Among surveyed bays, Biscayne Bay, Florida and Corpus Christi, Texas (northern Gulf of Mexico) had the greatest number of species (14 and 8, respectively); in contrast, almost all sites in Alaska, Washington, Oregon (northwest Pacific), Rhode Island, Virginia and South Carolina (Atlantic) had only one or two species each. Hydroides dianthus was, by far, the most abundant serpulid species on fouling plates in the northern Gulf of Mexico and the east coast, while Pseudochitinopoma occidentalis was the most abundant serpulid detected on the west coast. For each species recorded herein, we include the synonyms and some key references, a material studied section, a diagnosis, and updated distributional information. A checklist and identification key to the known shallow-water serpulids sensu stricto of the United States are included.","2017-08-17","2025-02-21 22:44:53","2025-02-21 22:44:53","2025-02-21 22:44:53","","","344","","","EJT","The fouling serpulids (Polychaeta","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/89BBY2NC/The fouling serpulids (Polychaeta Serpulidae) fro - Bastida-Zavala et al. - 2017.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The response of the resident communities will be a function of their ecophysiological constraints in low oxygen, although this remains untested in the NEP due to a lack of integrative studies. Here, we combine in situ surveys and lab‐based respirometry experiments were conducted on three indicator species (spot prawn               Pandalus platyceros               , slender sole               Lyopsetta exilis               , squat lobster               Munida quadrispina               ) of seasonally hypoxic systems in the NEP to test if metabolic constraints determine distributions and energy sequestration in a hypoxic setting.

Our results show that                              ‐based hypoxia thresholds are significantly lower in the East Pacific Ocean relative to other major ocean basins, which suggests that the physiological response of local fauna to deoxygenation can be determined by the natural variability and oxygen exposure in a region.

In the Gulf of California, these animals mature at large size (>55 cm mantle length) in 1–1.5 years and have supported a major commercial fishery in the Guaymas Basin during the last 20 years. An El Niño event in 2009–2010, was accompanied by a collapse of this fishery, and squid in the region showed major changes in the distribution and life‐history strategy. Large squid abandoned seasonal coastal‐shelf habitats in 2010 and instead were found in the Salsipuedes Basin to the north, an area buffered from the effects of El Niño by tidal upwelling and a well‐mixed water column. The commercial fishery also relocated to this region. Although large squid were not found in the Guaymas Basin from 2010 to 2012, small squid were abundant and matured at an unusually small mantle‐length (<30 cm) and young age (approximately 6 months). Juvenile squid thus appeared to respond to El Niño with an alternative life‐history trajectory in which gigantism and high fecundity in normally productive coastal‐shelf habitats were traded for accelerated reproduction at small size in an offshore environment. Both small and large mature squid, were present in the Salsipuedes Basin during 2011, indicating that both life‐ history strategies can coexist. Hydro‐acoustic data, reveal that squid biomass in this study area nearly doubled between 2010 and 2011, primarily due to a large increase in small squid that were not susceptible to the fishery. Such a climate‐driven switch in size‐at‐maturity may allow               D. gigas               to rapidly adapt to and cope with El Niño. This ability is likely to be an important factor in conjunction with longerterm climate‐change and the potential ecological impacts of this invasive predator on marine ecosystems.","2013-07","2025-02-21 22:45:10","2025-02-21 22:45:10","2025-02-21 22:45:10","2089-2103","","7","19","","Global Change Biology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to determine the diet composition and feeding habits of               I. oxyrinchus               in Ecuadorian waters. Samples were obtained from Santa Rosa fishing port (Ecuador). The total length (L               T               ), sex and sexual characteristics were recorded, and stomach contents were collected. A total of 142 individuals were recorded, comprising 81 females (104–295 cm L               T               ) and 61 males (127–245 cm L               T               ). A total of 24 prey species were identified, including crustaceans, cephalopods, teleosts and cetaceans.

Automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) indicated that there are separate communities at the two different vents and temporal community variations between each vent. Correlation analysis between chemistry and microbiology indicated that shifts in the coarse particulate (>1 mm) Fe/(Fe+Mn+Al), Cu, V, Ca, Al,               232               Th, and Ti as well as fine‐grained particulate (<1 mm) Fe/(Fe+Mn+Al), Fe, Ca, and Co are reflected in shifts in microbial populations. 16S rRNA clone libraries from each trap at three time points revealed a high percentage of Epsilonproteobacteria clones and hyperthermophilic Aquificae. There is a shift toward the end of the experiment to more Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, many of whom likely participate in Fe and S cycling. The particle‐attached plume environment is genetically distinct from the surrounding seawater. While work to date in hydrothermal environments has focused on determining the microbial communities on hydrothermal chimneys and the basaltic lavas that form the surrounding seafloor, little comparable data exist on the plume environment that physically and chemically connects them. By employing sediment traps for a time‐series approach to sampling, we show that bacterial community composition on plume particles changes on timescales much shorter than previously known.","2012-03","2025-02-21 22:45:13","2025-02-21 22:45:13","2025-02-21 22:45:13","178-192","","2","10","","Geobiology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/SDUQEMVI/Time‐series analysis of two hydrothermal plumes at - Sylvan et al. - 2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The environment is dominated by resuspension of particles from a well‐sorted sandy sediment. We obtain information on the suspended mineral matter from the relocatable numerical sedimentation model, TRANS98. Inputs for the model include bottom particle size distribution, wind speed, wave period and height, and near‐bottom current speed. Model output is a vertical profile of mineral particle concentrations and size distributions at selected depths. The mineral particle size distribution allows the calculation of the total scattering coefficient of suspended minerogenic matter. The particle size distribution for the bed at Oceanside is approximately Gaussian lognormal in character. The predicted size distribution near bottom is a skewed Gaussian lognormal; then the distribution shifts toward the increasing importance of smaller size classes as we approach the water surface. Deeper stations maintain a lognormal character up into the surface layers while the shallower stations switch to a particle size distribution of the smallest size class being the modal class in the surface layers. Hyperbolic size distributions have been proposed for the Oceanside site from optical observations. These distributions would have a slope of 2.1 for coastal water which would decrease to as low as 1.3 for shallow nearshore stations and near the bottom. None of the proposed hyperbolic slopes provides an adequate approximation of the particle distributions predicted by TRANS98. The larger particle size classes are significantly overestimated by hyperbolic models, which causes the total scattering coefficient of the minerogenic matter to be overestimated. These results indicate that hyperbolic slope models cannot be used to retrieve particle size distributions by inversions involving the total scattering coefficient nor are they accurate estimators of the minerogenic scattering coefficient.","2004-05","2025-02-21 22:45:16","2025-02-21 22:45:16","2025-02-21 22:45:16","2003JC002098","","C5","109","","J.

The geographic range of               M. l. lugubris               can be characterized by three different events in its history: an old sundering in the mid‐peninsular region of Baja (~ 417,000 years ago) and more recent northern range expansion and southern range contraction. The mid‐peninsular break is shared with many terrestrial and marine species, although               M. l. lugubris               represents the first mollusc to show it. This common break is often attributed to a hypothesized ancient seaway bisecting the peninsula, but for               M. l. lugubris               it may result from large habitat gaps in the southern clade. Northern clade populations, particularly near the historical northern limit (prior to the 1970s), have high local abundances and reside in a region with plentiful food and habitat – which makes its northern range conducive to expansion. The observed southern range contraction may result from the opposite scenario, with little food or habitat nearby. Our study highlights the importance of taking an integrative approach to understanding the processes that shape the geographic range of a species via combining range‐wide phylogeography data with temporal geographic distributions and spatial patterns of habitat/food availability.","2014-08","2025-02-21 22:45:20","2025-02-21 22:45:20","2025-02-21 22:45:20","3244-3255","","16","4","","Ecology and Evolution","Historical and recent processes shaping the geographic range of a rocky intertidal gastropod","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/AS6T3DCS/Historical and recent processes shaping the geogra - Fenberg et al. - 2014.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to predict future distributions of commercially important species in the eastern Bering Sea under six climate scenarios, by incorporating predictions of future oceanographic conditions. We used species distribution modelling to determine potential distribution changes in four time periods (2013–2017, 2030–2039, 2060–2069, and 2090-2099) relative to 1982–2012 for 16 marine fish and invertebrates. Most species were predicted to have significant shifts in the centre of gravity of the predicted abundance, the area occupied, and the proportion of the predicted abundance found in the standard bottom trawl survey area. On average the shifts were modest, averaging 35.2 km (ranging from 1 to 202 km). There were significant differences in the predicted trend for distribution metrics among climate scenarios, with the most extensive changes in distribution resulting from Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate scenarios. The variability in distributional shifts among years and climate scenarios was high, although the magnitudes were low. This study provides a basis for understanding where fish populations might expand or contract in future years. This will provide managers’ information that can help guide appropriate actions under warming conditions.","2021-03-24","2025-02-21 22:45:45","2025-02-21 22:45:45","2025-02-21 22:45:45","220-234","","1","78","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/XRSZ992P/Predicted shifts of groundfish distribution in the - Rooper et al. - 2021.pdf","","","","Bartolino, Valerio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interannual variability in size structure, age, and growth of jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) assessed by modal progression analysis. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: . A range of growth rates, longevity, maximum size, and number of annual cohorts have been documented for jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas). Genetic and phenotypic plasticity have been mentioned as possible sources of the differences in maximum sizes. Here, a large dataset on length frequencies derived from the industrial jig fishery for the species off Peru from 1991 to 2007 was corrected for observation bias introduced by the fishing gear and used to analyse growth-related parameters by modal progression analysis (MPA). Mean growth rates of 33 cohorts varied interannually (11–44 mm month−1), as did longevity (11.1–32.1 months) and mean maximum size (273–1024 mm). Intra-annual difference in growth parameters was not significant. The number of cohorts per year fluctuated between 0 and 6. Fast-growing cohorts with medium longevity and large terminal size were found during moderately cool periods, and long-lived, slow-growing cohorts with small terminal size during extreme ecosystem conditions (El Niño and La Niña). The application of MPA to cephalopod populations has been rejected before, but the results presented suggest that a modified approach is appropriate if it allows for varying growth parameters and includes a correction for observation bias.","2011-03-01","2025-02-21 22:45:52","2025-02-21 22:45:52","2025-02-21 22:45:52","507-518","","3","68","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/3NEDFDUE/Interannual variability in size structure, age, an - Keyl et al. - 2011.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The crab               Petrolisthes armatus               has a wide native range, which has expanded in the last three decades. We sequenced 1718 bp of mitochondrial DNA from native and recently established populations to determine the population structure of the former and the origin of the latter. There was phylogenetic separation between Atlantic and eastern Pacific populations, and between east and west Atlantic ones. Haplotypes on the coast of Florida and newly established populations in Georgia and South Carolina belong to a different clade from those from Yucatán to Brazil, though a few haplotypes are shared. In the Pacific, populations from Colombia and Ecuador are highly divergent from those from Panamá and the Sea of Cortez. In general, populations were separated hundreds to million years ago with little subsequent gene flow. High genetic diversity in the newly established populations shows that they were founded by many individuals. Range expansion appears to have been limited by low dispersal rather than lack of ability of marginal populations to adapt to extreme conditions.","2017-06-13","2025-02-21 22:46:00","2025-02-21 22:46:00","2025-02-21 22:46:00","3359","","1","7","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/6IYUK7FU/Phylogeography of Petrolisthes armatus, an invasiv - Hiller and Lessios - 2017.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the absence of pre‐dam studies, geohistorical data can play a critical role in reconstructing ecological aspects of the past ecosystem.

Based on uncertainty in the literature surrounding the membership of                 N. chemnitzii                 in the                 CRD                 benthic community before the dams were built, we predicted that, for pre‐dam samples,                 N. chemnitzii                 would be absent and there would be less variance in predator size selectivity and drillhole stereotypy.

Methods               At two localities we sampled naticid shells and collected bivalve prey from the tidal flat and pre‐dam era cheniers – dune‐like structures composed primarily of molluscan remains. Naticids were sorted and counted by species. Variation in the stereotypic placement of drillholes in the pre‐ and post‐dam construction eras was assessed by grouping drillholes into a nine‐sector grid superimposed on the prey's shell. Predator size was regressed on bivalve prey size to assess variation in predator size selectivity pre‐ and post‐damming of the Colorado River.                                         Results                                As predicted, we found no                 N. chemnitzii                 in cheniers of pre‐dam age, whereas another naticid species,                 Neverita reclusiana                 , was common.                 Notocochlis chemnitzii                 and                 N. reclusiana                 were found in the actively forming chenier and on the tidal flat. As expected with the addition of another naticid species, the preferred site of drilling and size selectivity of prey by predators changed significantly between cheniers from the pre‐ and post‐dam construction eras due to variation in prey‐handling behaviour by different naticid species.                                                        Main conclusions                                Geohistorical evidence, from body and trace fossils, suggests that                 N. chemnitzii                 has recently expanded its geographical range to the                 CRD                 , whereas                 N. reclusiana                 has long dwelled in the delta.

Therefore, temperate gastropods are predicted to be maladapted to highly specialized tropical shell-crushing crabs. The northern geographical limit of the lined shore crab (Pachygrapsus crassipes J.W. Randall, 1840) does not usually overlap with the southern limit of the Sitka periwinkle (Littorina sitkana Philippi, 1846), which lacks a pelagic larval stage. Large El Niño events increased the winter abundance and poleward transport of P. crassipes larvae from California (USA) in the Davidson Current. Temporary intertidal crab populations that included females with eggs were observed 1–4 years later, >1000 km north of its usual geographical range. Laboratory experiments showed that L. sitkana did not have a size refuge from adult P. crassipes. Moreover, consumption rates of adult L. sitkana by P. crassipes were 10-fold higher than those published for indigenous purple shore crabs (Hemigrapsus nudus (Dana, 1851)) with similar claw sizes. Additionally, the upper intertidal limit of invading P. crassipes was higher than that of H. nudus. Consequently, the invasion of P. crassipes reduced the width of L. sitkana‘s spatial refuge from predation. The permanent presence of this subtropical predator could reduce the intertidal distribution of this temperate gastropod, thereby causing contraction of its southern range limit.","2020-12","2025-02-21 22:46:08","2025-02-21 22:46:08","2025-02-21 22:46:08","787-797","","12","98","","Can.

Recent sampling of nemerteans in Oregon and Washington has begun to fill in these taxonomic gaps, but nemertean diversity in California has received relatively little attention over the past 60 years. During the summers of 2019 and 2020, nemertean specimens were collected from 20 locations in the Bodega Bay region of northern California, USA, including rocky intertidal shores, sandy beaches, mudflats, and other habitats. Based on morphological assessment and DNA sequence analysis (partial Cytochrome Oxidase I and 16S rRNA genes), our surveys identified 34 nemertean species. Only 13 of these (38%) can be confidently assigned to described species. Another 11 represent species that are new to science, including members of the genera               Riserius               ,               Nipponnemertes               ,               Poseidonemertes               ,               Zygonemertes               ,               Nemertellina               ,               Oerstedia               , and three species of uncertain affiliation.

Zooplankton abundance at Station ""P"" appears representative of that in a wide area of the central Gulf of Alaska. A vertical distribution of zooplankton characterized by maxima of concentration from 0–100 metres and from 200–500 m was observed both day and night and in all seasons. Daily means of concentration of surface zooplankton ranged from about 20 g per 1000 m               3               in winter to about 150 in summer. A small autumn maximum was observed. A similar seasonal cycle of abundance occurred down to depths of about 200 m. Below 200 m the amplitude of the seasonal cycle tended to decrease with depth.

A pronounced diurnal variation in the concentration of surface zooplankton was observed and showed the major features of typical diurnal vertical migration.

We analyzed the demographic (historic), genetic, and phylogeographic structure of P. pansa using a fragment of the cytochrome b gene (687 bp). Data were analyzed by analysis of molecular variance, nested clade analysis (NCA), and a mismatch distribution analysis under the expanding population hypothesis. A total of 219 organisms were collected from 16 localities along the Mexican Pacific coast and one in Costa Rica. We obtained a total of 92 haplotypes. Genetic differences among Mexican populations were low. The Clarión Island population was significantly different from 6 of the Mexican populations studied. This result was attributed to the fact that Clarión is an oceanic island and the currents veer offshore most of the year. Haplotype network and mismatch distribution analyses indicated that the Mexican populations are undergoing expansion. The NCA confirmed a contiguous range expansion of haplotypes and this result may be related to the time that larvae spend in marine currents and to the effect of natural barriers, such as gyres, in Central America and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.","2016-03-18","2025-02-21 22:46:17","2025-02-21 22:46:17","2025-02-21 22:46:17","1-14","","1","42","","Cienc.

Pyrosome blooms could alter pelagic food webs of the northern California Current (NCC) by accelerating the biological pump via active transport, fecal pellet production and mortality events. Although aggregations of P. atlanticum have the potential to shape marine trophic dynamics via carbon export, little is known about pyrosome vertical distribution patterns. In this study, we estimated the distribution of P. atlanticum in the NCC along transects off of Oregon (45°N and 124°W) and northern California (41°N and 124°W), USA during February and July 2018. Depth-stratified plankton tows provided volume-normalized pyrosome abundance and biovolume estimates that complemented fine-scale counts by a vertically deployed camera system. Pyrosomes were numerous offshore during February, especially off Oregon. Colonies were distributed non-uniformly in the water column with peak numbers associated with vertical gradients in environmental parameters, notably density and chl-a. Vertical distributions shifted over the 24-h period, indicative of diel vertical migration. Understanding the vertical distribution of these gelatinous grazers in the NCC gives insight to their behavior and ecological role in biologically productive temperate ecosystems as conditions become more favorable for recurring blooms.","2022-03-24","2025-02-21 22:46:20","2025-02-21 22:46:20","2025-02-21 22:46:20","288-302","","2","44","","","","","","","","","","en","https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/JCEDTPR5/Fine-scale vertical distribution and diel migratio - Lyle et al. - 2022.pdf","","","","Koski, Marja","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since then, the population has increased in size and distribution and has become self-reproducing and of economic importance. We implemented genetic analysis to identify the origin and pathway of introduction of BAR snow crab. Samples from BAR, Alaska, eastern Canada, and west Greenland were genotyped with 12 microsatellite loci. Pairwise FST between 15 samples showed three geographic clusters, each significantly different from one another. Unexpectedly, the largest genetic distance was between the BAR and Greenland clusters. This clustering may be the result of dispersals through Bering Strait from the North Pacific Ocean and passage through the Arctic Ocean. The BAR samples did not show signs of a bottleneck in population size, as would be expected after introduction of small numbers of individuals. Presence of snow crab in the BAR may thus be the result of recent natural range expansion from around Alaska.","2022-11-25","2025-02-21 22:46:36","2025-02-21 22:46:36","2025-02-21 22:46:36","2389-2398","","9","79","","","","","","","","","","en","https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/HDSINVBR/Genetic analysis of the exploited snow crab ( C - Dahle et al. - 2022.pdf","","","","Grant, W Stewart","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on these expeditions and published literature, we compiled voucher specimens, images, and 274 newly published DNA sequences to present a taxonomic inventory of macrofaunal and megafaunal diversity with a focus on invertebrates. In total 488 morphospecies were identified, representing the highest number of distinct morphospecies published from a single seep or vent region to date. Of these, 131 are described species, at least 58 are undescribed species, and the remainder include some degree of taxonomic uncertainty, likely representing additional undescribed species. Of the described species, 38 are known only from the Costa Rica seeps and their vicinity. Fifteen range extensions are also reported for species known from Mexico, the Galápagos seamounts, Chile, and the western Pacific; as well as 16 new depth records and three new seep records for species known to occur at vents or organic falls.

(1) Autoregressive models were fitted to time‐series data for multiple species using climate indices as external regressors. The resulting regression coefficients for each species we term a climate‐index response profile (CIRP). (2) Mechanistic hypotheses were rejected based on the summary response profile across species obtained by meta‐analysis. (3) Monte‐Carlo simulations of the CIRPs for all species at all sites were performed to generate null expectations to test the significance of nonrejected hypotheses. We applied this method to historical data of 56 nudibranch species from three intertidal sites studied independently in central California during nonoverlapping time periods between 1969 and 1995, combined with recent resurveys from these same sites. Adult populations are strongly correlated with the multivariate El Niño‐Southern Oscillation index and sea‐surface height, increasing during El Niño and decreasing during La Niña events. Our data are consistent with recruitment limitation via larval advection as the primary driver of adult abundance variation. El Niño conditions increase recruitment by cross‐shelf onshore advection of larvae from both southern and northern populations, and alongshore larval advection from southern source populations. We hypothesize that recent declines of California nudibranchs are temporary, and populations will recover as El Niño conditions return to the California current.","2011-03","2025-02-21 22:46:49","2025-02-21 22:46:49","2025-02-21 22:46:49","749-763","","2","56","","Limnology & Oceanography","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/EE7PZVYE/Climate‐index response profiling indicates larval - Schultz et al. - 2011.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In accordance with neutral expectations for stable populations, nuclear microsatellite diversity positively correlated with niche stability from the               LGM               to present. Most strikingly, nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite variation significantly correlated with               LGM               climate, even after controlling for associations with geographic location and present climate using partial redundancy analyses. Variance partitioning showed that               LGM               climate uniquely explains a similar proportion of genetic variance as present climate (16% vs. 11–18%), and together, past and present climate explains more than geography (19%). Climate can influence local expansion–contraction dynamics, flowering phenology and thus gene flow, and/or impose selective pressures. These results highlight the lingering effect of past climate on genetic variation in species with stable distributions.","2013-07","2025-02-21 22:46:50","2025-02-21 22:46:50","2025-02-21 22:46:50","3598-3612","","13","22","","Molecular Ecology","Influence of late <span style=""font-variant","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their intramolluscan stages develop in marine and brackish-water gastropods, while metacercariae develop in molluscs and fishes. The systematics of renicolids is poorly developed, their life cycles are mostly unknown, and the statuses of many species require revision. Here, we establish based on integrated morphological and molecular data that adult renicolids from gulls               Larus argentatus               and               Larus schistisagus               and sporocysts and cercariae of               Cercaria parvicaudata               from marine snails               Littorina               spp. are life-cycle stages of the same species.

In               Littorina saxatilis               and               L. obtusata               from the Barents Sea, molecular analysis has revealed intramolluscan stages of               Cercaria littorinae saxatilis               VIII, a cryptic species relative to               R. parvicaudatus               .

As climate change alters ocean conditions, the dispersal of these larvae will be affected, with pervasive ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review the impacts of oceanic changes on larval transport, physiology, and behavior. We then discuss the implications for population connectivity and recruitment and evaluate life history strategies that will affect susceptibility to the effects of climate change on their dispersal patterns, with implications for understanding selective regimes in a future ocean. We find that physical oceanographic changes will impact dispersal by transporting larvae in different directions or inhibiting their movements while changing environmental factors, such as temperature,               pH               , salinity, oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and turbidity, will affect the survival of larvae and alter their behavior. Reduced dispersal distance may make local adaptation more likely in well‐connected populations with high genetic variation while reduced dispersal success will lower recruitment with implications for fishery stocks. Increased dispersal may spur adaptation by increasing genetic diversity among previously disconnected populations as well as increasing the likelihood of range expansions. We hypothesize that species with planktotrophic (feeding), calcifying, or weakly swimming larvae with specialized adult habitats will be most affected by climate change. We also propose that the adaptive value of retentive larval behaviors may decrease where transport trajectories follow changing climate envelopes and increase where transport trajectories drive larvae toward increasingly unsuitable conditions. Our holistic framework, combined with knowledge of regional ocean conditions and larval traits, can be used to produce powerful predictions of expected impacts on larval dispersal as well as the consequences for connectivity, range expansion, or recruitment. Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies take a holistic view of dispersal incorporating biological and oceanographic impacts of climate change rather than solely focusing on oceanography or physiology. Genetic and paleontological techniques can be used to examine evolutionary impacts of altered dispersal in a future ocean, while museum collections and expedition records can inform modern‐day range shifts.","2020-01","2025-02-21 22:46:56","2025-02-21 22:46:56","2025-02-21 22:46:56","e03015","","1","11","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/WHMZAGVR/Larval dispersal in a changing ocean with an empha - Bashevkin et al. - 2020.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Range overlap with predators that induce the response and local demographics (e.g., prey abundances) are likely to be important factors for determining the biogeographic distribution of induced defences within species. However, with climate warming, range‐expanding warm‐water predators are increasingly preying upon temperate species. This is a consequence of a wider phenomenon known as tropicalisation. We aim to determine: (i) if individuals of a temperate barnacle with induced defences (‘bent morphs’) are primarily present where they co‐occur with range‐expanding warm‐water predators (muricid snails) and, (ii) if bent morphs are size‐structured within populations.

We use a combination of field surveys, literature, and museum occurrences to assess range overlap between cool and warm‐water predators of                 T. rubescens                 and their association with populations with bent morphs and abundance patterns of                 T. rubescens                 .                                                        Results               Bent morphs are commonly found within the equatorward portion of the species' range (where abundances are highest), in populations overlapping with range‐expanding warm‐water predators. Bent morphs primarily occur within the smaller size classes.                                         Main conclusions                                To be partly resilient to the effects of tropicalisation, temperate prey must acclimatise/adapt to altered predator–prey dynamics. Predator‐induced defences are one way to do this. We show that bent morphs within a temperate prey species (                 T. rubescens                 ) are largely restricted to populations that overlap with large‐bodied and range‐expanding warm‐water predators. This is evidence for the partial resilience of                 T. rubescens                 to tropicalisation and provides the rationale for further exploration of the eco‐evolutionary consequences of tropicalisation in this study system and others.                                       ,                             Objetivo               La biogeografía de las defensas inducidas por depredación es poco estudiada en la dinámica depredador‐presa. Es problable que el traslape de la distribución de depredadores y las características demográficas locales determinene la distribución biogeográfica local como la abundancia de presas. Con el cambio climático, los depredadores con afinidad tropical aumentan el traslape con presas de afinidad templada. Esto es un efecto indirecto conocido como tropicalización. Pretendemos determinar: (i) si la morfología de defensa inducida (‘morfotipo curvo’), de balanos con afinidad templada solo están presentes en poblaciones donde la distribución se traslapa con depredadores con afinidad tropical expandiendo su rango de distribución al norte (caracoles murícidos) y, (ii) si el morfotipo curvo tiene una estructura de talla dentro de sus poblaciones.                                         Ubicación               Zona intermareal rocosa del Pacífico Nororiental (~26–40° N).

Métodos                                Determinamos la estructura de tallas y distribución geográfica de las poblaciones con el morfotipo curvo del balano templado                 T. rubescens                 con foto‐cuadrantes. Combinamos campo, literatura y registros de museos para evaluar los patrones de abundancia y distribución geográfica del morfotipo curvo y su traslape con depredadores de afinidad templada y tropical.                                                        Resultados               El morfotipo curvo como defensa inducida se encuentra principalmente en tallas pequeñas al sur del rango de distribución de la especie (donde la abundancia es más alta) y en poblaciones donde se traslapa con la expansión norteña de los depredadores con afinidad tropical.                                         Principales conclusiones                                Para ser parcialmente resiliente a los efectos de la tropicalización, las presas con afinidad templada deben encontrar formas de aclimatarse/adaptarse ante las dinámicas de depredación‐presa. Una forma de hacer esto son las defensas inducidas por depredación. Demostramos que el morfotipo curvo de (                 T. rubescens                 ) están restringida a poblaciones que se sobrelapan con la expansión norteña de los depredadores de mayor tamaño con afinidad tropical. Esto evidencía la resiliencia parcial de esta especie y proporciona la base para explorar las consecuencias eco‐evolutivas de la tropicalización.","2023-12","2025-02-21 22:47:14","2025-02-21 22:47:14","2025-02-21 22:47:14","2148-2159","","12","50","","Journal of Biogeography","Predator‐induced defences under tropicalisation","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/YQVETCJM/Predator‐induced defences under tropicalisation A - Fenberg et al. - 2023.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods               We conducted a literature review to identify major biogeographic barriers along the east and west coasts of North America, and then assessed the permeability of these barriers to larval dispersal using Lagrangian particle tracking. We ran a series of simulations in which we varied the suitable habitat distribution, planktonic larval duration, and spawning seasonality of simulated larvae (i.e., particles) to assess the effects of species traits on biogeography.                                         Results               Our results showed a strong alignment of observed biogeographic barriers with larval dispersal patterns, with high variation in barrier permeability depending on the traits of the species considered.

The evolution of novel migration routes can play an important role in range expansions, ecological interactions, and speciation. New migration routes may evolve in response to selection in favor of reducing distance between breeding and wintering areas, or avoiding navigational barriers. Many migratory changes are likely to evolve gradually and are therefore difficult to study. Here, we attempt to connect breeding and wintering populations of myrtle warblers (               Setophaga coronata coronata               ) to better understand the possible evolution of distinct migration routes within this species. Myrtle warblers, unlike most other warblers with breeding ranges primarily in eastern North America, have two disjunct overwintering concentrations—one in the southeastern               USA               and one along the Pacific Coast—and presumably distinct routes to‐and‐from these locations. We studied both myrtle and Audubon's warblers (               S. c. auduboni               ) captured during their spring migration along the Pacific Coast, south of the narrow region where these two taxa hybridize. Using stable hydrogen isotopes and biometric data, we show that those myrtle warblers wintering along the southern Pacific Coast of North America are likely to breed at high latitudes in Alaska and the Yukon rather than in Alberta or further east. Our interpretation is that the evolution of this wintering range and migration route along the Pacific Coast may have facilitated the breeding expansion of myrtle warblers into northwestern North America. Moreover, these data suggest that there may be a migratory divide within genetically similar populations of myrtle warblers.","2017-09","2025-02-21 22:47:20","2025-02-21 22:47:20","2025-02-21 22:47:20","6649-6658","","17","7","","Ecology and Evolution","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/HW5WCYE2/Linking the wintering and breeding grounds of warb - Toews et al. - 2017.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several dominant species which occurred throughout the monitoring period provide continuity between early sampling efforts and recent ones. Annual fluctuations in the mean number of species, abundance, diversity and biomass were generally conservative compared to spatial fluctuations. Temporal changes of note include a marked reduction in abundance and biomass between 1981 and 1984 and another decline in biomass in 1988. The former was associated with conditions of the 1982–1983 El Niño, and the latter with a shift in population dominance from a bivalve to a polychaete.             Mean abundance and biomass were enhanced by the outfall without a significant reduction in number of species.

By simultaneously monitoring densities of zooplankton (primarily the euphausiid;               Euphausia pacifica               ) and zooplanktivorous fish (Pacific herring,               Clupea pallasii               , and Pacific hake,               Mercluccius productus               ), and the feeding of zooplanktivorous fish, we could separate the effects of dissolved oxygen on fish–zooplankton interactions from other seasonal changes. We expected that fish predators (especially Pacific herring) would be less abundant and have lower feeding rates when oxygen levels declined below biological thresholds, and that this would result in increased zooplankton abundance in areas with lowest dissolved oxygen. However, these expectations were not borne out. Overall, there was mixed evidence for an effect of dissolved oxygen on many of our response variables, and when effects were detected, they were frequently in the opposite direction of our expectations. Specifically, the pelagic fish community became more abundant (as measured by increasing acoustic backscatter), which was particularly pronounced for Pacific herring. Zooplankton had weak evidence for a response to dissolved oxygen, but the direction was negative instead of positive. Although predator feeding composition was unrelated to dissolved oxygen, stomach fullness (an index of feeding intensity) of Pacific herring declined, as per our expectations. These unexpected findings highlight the importance of in situ measurements of multiple aspects of predator–prey linkages in response to environmental stress to enhance our ability to predict ecological consequences of declining oxygen.","2020-12","2025-02-21 22:47:49","2025-02-21 22:47:49","2025-02-21 22:47:49","e02204","","8","30","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we analyse changes in the southern endpoints of distribution of rocky intertidal species (gastropods and chitons) along the Chilean coast, and trends in sea surface temperature (SST), using data collected during the last half‐century.                                         Location                South‐eastern Pacific coast, between 18°20′ S and 42°35′ S.                                         Methods                Past southern endpoints of distribution were obtained for 10 intertidal species from museum collections and literature reviews. Current endpoints are based on field sampling conducted between 1998 and 2000. Changes in the position of southern endpoints were analysed individually for each species, as well as for the entire assemblage of species included in the analysis. SST records encompassing 51–57 years were obtained from five coastal stations located between 18° and 36° S.                                         Results and main conclusions                Most species (eight of 10) did not show expansion of their southern endpoint. The proportion of species expanding, contracting or maintaining their southern limit did not differ from chance expectation. On average, species showed small (1° latitude), non‐significant contractions, with low rates of decadal change (0.18° latitude per 10 years). This pattern can be explained by changes in SST, which showed a weak warming trend (and at some sites even cooling) along the Chilean coast during the last 57 years. Our results show that different regional warming trends occur, and suggest that generalizations about poleward shifts in species ranges cannot be made. However, our results support the hypothesis that temperature is a major determinant of species range dynamics.","2005-02","2025-02-21 22:48:27","2025-02-21 22:48:27","2025-02-21 22:48:27","203-209","","2","32","","Journal of Biogeography","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These characters are the various external features, alternation of the genital pores, prominence of the genital atrium (=presence/absence of a genital papilla), and the structure and position of the uterus. Additional distinguishing features include the number and distribution of the testes (antiporal vs. poral+antiporal), length and shape of the cirrus sac, presence/absence of the retractor muscle of the cirrus sac, size and shape of the ovary and length of the vagina. In the key provided, the basal dichotomies are based on the alternation of the genital pores and the capability to form a genital papilla, which are easily observed in stained specimens.","2009-03-30","2025-02-21 22:48:29","2025-02-21 22:48:29","2025-02-21 22:48:29","","","1","2057","","Zootaxa","A taxonomic revision of the genus Anoplocephaloides Baer, 1923 sensu Rausch (1976), with the description of four new genera (Cestoda","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/7U2BDDME/A taxonomic revision of the genus Anoplocephaloide - Haukisalmi - 2009.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here I present a simple model that explores the role of biogeography in constraining changes in the compositions of species assemblages under the null hypothesis of random range shifts. The model predicts that localities where most species are far away from the edges of their ranges (e.g., localities at the center of a biogeographic province) would show relatively stable diversity patterns even during episodes of climatic change. Only localities with many range endpoints (such as those near the edges of biogeographic provinces) would show large fluctuations in species composition (and richness) in response to changes in the ambient climatic conditions. I test the predictions of the model using (1) simulations and (2) the Pleistocene bivalve fauna of California. The simulations as well as the empirical data from the Pleistocene terraces are consistent with the model predictions. These results show that attempts to quantify temporal trends in local and regional diversity and assemblage compositions need to take biogeographic structure into account.","2001","2025-02-21 22:48:30","2025-02-21 22:48:30","2025-02-21 22:48:30","631-645","","4","27","","Paleobiology","Analyzing temporal trends in regional diversity","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluation of the distribution and abundance of Teredinidae is a very important task, as the impact of the destruction of wood in man-made structures is still underestimated, mainly in tropical regions. It is also know that temperature and salinity are key factors affecting the abundance and activity of Teredinidae due to their effects on the physiological responses of Teredinidae. The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution and abundance of Teredinidae along the Rio de Janeiro coast according to temperature range and pattern. Artificial pine collectors were used and remained immersed for three months in four regions at 14 sites. We recorded seven species of Teredinidae, identified according to their pallets. Ilha Grande Bay was the region with the highest density and species richness, and the region with the lowest was Guanabara Bay. One gradient of abundance related to temperature was found. The most abundant species were Lyrodus floridanus and Teredo furcifera. Besides temperature, wood availability among regions was another important factor. For the first time, we recorded the occurrence of Bankia destructa on the Rio de Janeiro coast, but this record does not indicate any species introduction or expanding distribution range.           ,              Resumo Teredinidae são moluscos marinhos ou estuarinos perfuradores e degradadores de madeira. Avaliar sua distribuição e abundância se mostrou importante, uma vez que a destruição de madeira é ainda subestimada, sobretudo em regiões tropicais. Dados de literatura têm mostrado também que temperatura e salinidade são dois fatores que afetam fisiologicamente as espécies de Teredinidae. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram avaliar a distribuição e abundância de Teredinidae ao longo da costa do Rio de Janeiro, em relação ao padrão de temperatura e sua variação. Coletores artificiais de pinho foram imersos por três meses em 14 localidades em quatro regiões do estado. Sete espécies foram registradas e identificadas pela forma de suas palhetas. Os maiores valores de densidade e riqueza específica foram registrados na Baía da Ilha Grande e os menores, na Baía de Guanabara. Foi observado um gradiente na abundância relacionado à temperatura.

The blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), native to the Mediterranean Sea, is a leading invasive species of intertidal coasts throughout much of the world. Here, we used mitochondrial DNA sequence data to investigate the genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure of invasive (M. galloprovincialis) versus native (Mytilus chilensis) populations of blue mussels in Chile. We evaluated whether genetic diversity in invasive populations could be explained by the genetic characteristics of the native sources from which they might be derived. A phylogenetic analysis confirmed two lineages of the invasive M. galloprovincialis, i.e., the NW Atlantic and the Mediterranean lineages. We found no evidence of genetic structure in the invasive range of M. galloprovincialis in Chile, most probably because of its recent arrival. We did, however, detect a spatial mixture of both M. galloprovincialis lineages at sampling locations along the Chilean coast, giving rise to higher levels of genetic diversity in some areas compared to the population of native M. chilensis. The coastal area of the invasion is still small in extent (~100 km on either side of two large ports), which supports the hypothesis of a recent introduction. Further expansion of the distribution range of M. galloprovincialis may be limited to the north by increasing water temperatures and to the south by a natural biogeographic break that may slow or perhaps stop its spread. The use of internal borders as a tool to minimise or prevent M. galloprovincialis spread is therefore a genuine management option in Chile but needs to be implemented rapidly.","2024-03-07","2025-02-21 22:48:48","2025-02-21 22:48:48","2025-02-21 22:48:48","823","","6","14","","Animals","The Mediterranean Mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mollusca","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/HSWJ8IXB/The Mediterranean Mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis - Oyarzún et al. - 2024.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 308 species of the five main classes of benthic molluscs were obtained (106 bivalves, 185 gastropods, 13 polyplacophorans, two scaphopods and two cephalopods). This is a significant increase in the number of species (246 new records) compared to the 62 species previously recorded more than 10 years ago. The distribution in the 31 localities of the bay is given for the first time for most of the species, together with information on its ecological rarity (incidence in the samples). Two families of bivalves (Veneridae and Mytilidae) and three families of gastropods (Calyptraeidae, Muricidae and Collumbellidae) comprised ~ 30% of all species. Ecological rarity was evident with 45 families (45.0%) with only one species and 178 species (57.8%) collected in one site and 67 (21.8%) in two sites. The molluscs of Bahía de Chamela represent 12.2% of all species recorded in the Mexican Pacific. Their biogeographic affinities are mostly related to the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) including the oceanic islands and a few are restricted to the Tropical Mexican Pacific (TMP). Some have broader distributions to adjacent northern and southern temperate regions of the American Pacific, one to the western Atlantic, two pantropical (PAN) and two cosmopolitans (COS). The range distribution of each species was reviewed and updated, thus finding that seven species have extended their ranges of geographic distribution.","2020-12-11","2025-02-21 22:49:02","2025-02-21 22:49:02","2025-02-21 22:49:02","e59191","","","8","","BDJ","","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/6XYFELDZ/Species richness and biogeographical affinities of - Ríos-Jara et al. - 2020.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, comparative analyses using several species for one gene and/or multiple genes for one species can serve as a test for potential selective effects and clarify our understanding of historical demographic effects. This study compares nucleotide polymorphisms in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I across seven deep‐sea hydrothermal vent species that live along the volcanically active East Pacific Rise. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method, developed to trace shared vicariant events across species pairs, indicates the occurrence of two across species divergence times, and suggests that the present geographical patterns of genetic differentiation may be explained by two periods of significant population isolation. The oldest period dates back 11.6 Ma and is associated with the vent limpet               Lepetodrilus elevatus               , while the most recent period of isolation is 1.3 Ma, which apparently affected all species examined and coincides with a transition zone across the equator. Moreover, significant negative Tajima’s               D               and star‐like networks were observed for all southern lineages, suggesting that these lineages experienced a concomitant demographic and geographical expansion about 100 000–300 000 generations ago. This expansion may have initiated from a wave of range expansions during the secondary colonization of new sites along the Southern East Pacific Rise (founder effects below the equator) or recurrent bottleneck events because of the increase of eruptive phases associated with the higher spreading rates of the ridge in this region.","2009-09","2025-02-21 22:49:12","2025-02-21 22:49:12","2025-02-21 22:49:12","3903-3917","","18","18","","Molecular Ecology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/22QJ254W/Comparative phylogeography among hydrothermal vent - Plouviez et al. - 2009.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As species range shifts result in novel encounters between predators and prey, identifying prey ‘guilds’, based on a suite of shared traits, can distill complex species interactions, and aid in predicting food web dynamics. To support advances in trait-based research in open-ocean systems, we present the Pelagic Species Trait Database, an extensive resource documenting functional traits of 529 pelagic fish and invertebrate species in a single, open-source repository. We synthesized literature sources and online resources, conducted morphometric analysis of species images, as well as laboratory analyses of trawl-captured specimens to collate traits describing 1) habitat use and behavior, 2) morphology, 3) nutritional quality, and 4) population status information. Species in the dataset primarily inhabit the California Current system and broader NE Pacific Ocean, but also includes pelagic species known to be consumed by top ocean predators from other ocean basins. The aim of this dataset is to enhance the use of trait-based approaches in marine ecosystems and for predator populations worldwide.","2024-01-12","2025-02-21 22:49:16","2025-02-21 22:49:16","2025-02-21 22:49:16","2","","1","11","","Sci Data","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/N4Y3SCD8/The Pelagic Species Trait Database, an open data r - Gleiber et al. - 2024.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine the population biology of an example system using the recent northward range expansion of the marine neogastropod               Kelletia kelletii               (Forbes, 1852).                                         Location               This is a marine coastal shelf neogastropod species whose range extends from Isla Asuncion (Baja California, Mexico) to Monterey (CA, USA).

Methods               We examine abundance distributions and size frequency distributions of               K. kelletii               for evidence of factors determining historic and contemporary distributional patterns. Population studies were supplemented by historic and contemporary hydrographic data, including seawater temperature data from California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI ) and National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), and seawater circulation data.                                         Results               The structure of recently established populations varied dramatically from that of historic populations. Markedly low densities and irregular size frequency distributions characterized recently established populations and suggested only occasionally successful recruitment. The point of transition between historic and recently established populations also corresponded to the location of a gradient in seawater temperature and the confluence of two major oceanic currents. The accumulated data suggest that temperature and/or barriers to dispersal could have set both contemporary patterns in population structure as well as the former northern range limit.                                         Main conclusions               Early life stages play a critical role in determining distributional patterns of               K. kelletii               . Dispersal barriers and temperature limitation are two plausible mechanisms that could determine both contemporary and historic distributional patterns. Future studies on this species should attempt to tease apart the relative importance of these factors in maintaining the populations at the northern edge of the range.","2003-06","2025-02-21 22:49:19","2025-02-21 22:49:19","2025-02-21 22:49:19","913-924","","6","30","","Journal of Biogeography","The limits to biogeographical distributions","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many characteristics of its mating behavior, general life history, and larval biology are known, but details about its larval morphology and behavior are lacking. Here, aspects of its larval development and morphology during early ontogeny are chronicled, including larval velar form and function, asymmetrical development, particle ingestion, larval yolk reserves, and larval shell morphology. Snail oviposition behavior was observed in aquaria and egg capsules were dissected at different stages of development and examined under optical and scanning electron microscopy. Egg capsules had undeveloped eggs and/or embryos that were not ingested by K. kelletii larvae. Hatching time (natural excapsulation) varied between 37 to 55 d depending on water conditions, and endogenous yolk reserves were present in most veligers at capsule emergence. Pre-hatching veligers could swim in the plankton if excapsulated at 27 d and had symmetrical velar lobes but different sized cephalic tentacles. At 2.5 weeks in the plankton, both cephalic tentacles and velar lobes were asymmetrical, with those on the larvae’s right larger than those on their left. Larval shells were brittle and poorly mineralized at excapsulation but fully mineralized with an apertural beak and proto-siphonal canal by 2.5 weeks in the plankton. Particle capture and transport through the velar lobes to the mouth was possible in pre-hatching veligers, but ingestion only occurred in emerged veligers when yolk stores were depleted. Chronicling early ontogeny and its sequence, as in this study, is essential to the understanding of larval development and its evolution in gastropods, and to comparative studies of larval biology in the Buccinidae.","2020-12-18","2025-02-21 22:49:20","2025-02-21 22:49:20","2025-02-21 22:49:20","","","4","46","","Cienc.

In addition, we show that successful invasive species of bivalves in present‐day marine habitats also tend to be large‐bodied, despite the difference in mechanisms between present‐day and Pleistocene range expansions. These results indicate that range limits of large‐bodied bivalve species are more unstable than small‐bodied ones, and that body size and its correlates need to be considered when attempting to predict the responses of marine communities to climate change, biotic interchanges and human‐mediated invasions.","2001-07-22","2025-02-21 22:49:22","2025-02-21 22:49:22","2025-02-21 22:49:22","366-370","","4","4","","Ecology Letters","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we provide a comprehensive phylogeographical study of a species distributed along the Southeast Pacific coastal region by analyzing the endemic gastropod               Thaisella chocolata               (Duclos, 1832). Sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (               CO1               ) and 16S rRNA revealed strikingly high haplotypic nucleotide and genetic diversity but a lack of significant population differentiation within the survey area. In addition, a star‐shaped phylogeny and significantly negative Tajima's D and Fu's Fs tests of neutrality suggested historical occurrence of rapid demographic expansion. Mismatch distributions and Bayesian inference analyses also confirmed               T. chocolata               to have undergone two ancestral demographic expansions. Calculations suggested that these expansions began in the lower and middle Pleistocene epoch, likely due to continental shelf development and climatic conditions. These findings could help establish a genetic baseline for               T. chocolata               as the first step toward sustainable spatial management of this species, as well as understand this species’ response to future climate change.","2022-09","2025-02-21 22:50:19","2025-02-21 22:50:19","2025-02-21 22:50:19","e9276","","9","12","","Ecology and Evolution","Population structure and demographic history of the gastropod <i>Thaisella chocolata</i> (Duclos, 1832) from the Southeast Pacific inferred from mitochondrial <span style=""font-variant","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/VC9D6J97/Population structure and demographic history of th - Zelada‐Mázmela et al. - 2022.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concern is heightened by recent findings suggesting that shell formation and developmental progress are already impacted when               Ω               falls below 1.5. Here, we quantify the impact of low               Ω               conditions on pteropods using an individual‐based model (IBM) with life‐stage‐specific mortality, growth, and behavior in a high‐resolution regional hindcast simulation of the CalCS between 1984 and 2019. Special attention is paid to attributing this impact to different processes that lead to such low               Ω               conditions, namely natural variability, long‐term trend, and extreme events. We find that much of the observed damage in the CalCS, and specifically >70% of the shell CaCO               3               loss, is due to the pteropods' exposure to naturally occurring low               Ω               conditions as a result of their diel vertical migration (DVM). Over the hindcast period, their exposure to damaging waters (               Ω                < 1.5) increases from 9% to 49%, doubling their shell CaCO               3               loss, and increasing their mortality by ~40%. Most of this increased exposure is due to the shoaling of low               Ω               waters driven by the long‐term trend in OA. Extreme OA events amplify this increase by ~40%. Our approach can quantify the health of pteropod populations under shifting environmental conditions, and attribute changes in fitness or population structure to changes in the stressor landscape across hierarchical time scales.","2024-06","2025-02-21 22:50:23","2025-02-21 22:50:23","2025-02-21 22:50:23","e17345","","6","30","","Global Change Biology","The impact of aragonite saturation variability on shelled pteropods","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Demographic traits can vary across populations spanning latitudinal and elevational ranges, with impacts on population growth. Understanding how demography varies across gradients from range center to edge could help us predict future shifts, species assemblages, and extinction risks. We investigated demographic traits for 2 range-expanding whelk species:               Acanthinucella spirata               and               Mexacanthina lugubris.               We measured reproductive output across environmental (latitudinal and shore elevation) gradients along the coast of California, USA. We also conducted intensive measurements of offspring condition (survival and thermal tolerance) across shore elevation for               M. lugubris               at one site. We found no difference in reproductive output, body size, or larval survival across shore heights for               M. lugubris,               suggesting that egg-laying behavior buffers developing stages from the relatively high level of thermal variation experienced due to daily tidal emersion. However, across latitudes, reproductive output increased toward the leading range edge for               A. spirata               , and body size increased for both species. Increased vital rates at the leading range edge could increase whelk population growth and expansion, allowing species to persist under climate change even if contractions occur at trailing edges.","2024-02-08","2025-02-21 22:50:25","2025-02-21 22:50:25","2025-02-21 22:50:25","115-121","","","728","","Mar.

Two hypotheses can explain the modern high latitude distributions of these marine taxa: (1) survival in northern refugia during the LGM or (2) rapid post‐glacial dispersal by nonlarval stages. To distinguish these two scenarios, I characterized the genetic structure of two closely related northeastern Pacific gastropods that lack planktonic larvae but which have distributions extending more than 1000 km north of the southern limit of glaciers at the LGM. Despite having identical larval dispersal potential, these closely related species exhibit fundamentally different patterns of genetic structure. In               Nucella ostrina               , haplotype diversity among northern populations (British Columbia and Alaska) is low, no pattern of isolation by distance exists and a coalescent‐based model of population growth indicates that during the LGM population size was reduced to less than 35% of its current size. In the congeneric and often sympatric               N. lamellosa               , northern populations harbour a diversity of ancient private haplotypes, significant evidence of isolation by distance exists and regional subdivision was found between northern (Alaska) and southern (southern British Columbia, Washington and Oregon) populations. Estimates of coalescent parameters indicate only a modest reduction in population size during the LGM and that northern and southern populations of               N. lamellosa               split ∼50 Kyr before the LGM. The patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that               N. ostrina               recently reinvaded the northeastern Pacific but               N. lamellosa               survived the LGM in a northern refuge. A comparison of similar studies in this region indicates that depleted levels of genetic variation at high latitudes — evidence suggestive of recent colonization from a southern refuge — is more common among intertidal species that live relatively high on the shore, where exposure times to cold stress in air are longer than for species living lower on the shore. These data suggest that for some faunas, ecological differences between taxa may be more important than larval dispersal potential in determining species’ long‐term biogeographical responses to climate change.","2004-03","2025-02-21 22:50:27","2025-02-21 22:50:27","2025-02-21 22:50:27","597-611","","3","13","","Molecular Ecology","‘What's larvae got to do with it?","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there has been considerable research on the impacts of individual changes in water temperature, carbonate chemistry, and other variables on species, cumulative impacts of these effects have rarely been studied. Here, we simulate changes in (i) primary productivity, (ii) species range shifts, (iii) zooplankton community size structure, (iv) ocean acidification, and (v) ocean deoxygenation both individually and together using five Ecopath with Ecosim models of the northeast Pacific Ocean. We used a standardized method to represent climate effects that relied on time-series forcing functions: annual multipliers of species productivity. We focused on changes in fisheries landings, biomass, and ecosystem characteristics (diversity and trophic indices). Fisheries landings generally declined in response to cumulative effects and often to a greater degree than would have been predicted based on individual climate effects, indicating possible synergies. Total biomass of fished and unfished functional groups displayed a decline, though unfished groups were affected less negatively. Some functional groups (e.g. pelagic and demersal invertebrates) were predicted to respond favourably under cumulative effects in some regions. The challenge of predicting climate change impacts must be met if we are to adapt and manage rapidly changing marine ecosystems in the 21st century.","2011-07-01","2025-02-21 22:50:29","2025-02-21 22:50:29","2025-02-21 22:50:29","1217-1229","","6","68","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/VIMLE8Y7/Potential impacts of climate change on Northeast P - Ainsworth et al. - 2011.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Hells Canyon locality preserves lenses of silicified shells formed as tempestites in a shallow subtidal carbonate environment. These shell assemblages are parautochthonous and reflect local, rather than long-distance, transport. Silicification at this locality involved small-scale replacement of original calcareous microstructures, or small-scale replacement of neomorphosed shells, without an intervening phase of moldic porosity. This incremental replacement of carbonate by silica contrasts markedly with void-filling silicification textures reported previously from silicified Permian bivalve assemblages.             The bivalve paleoecology of this site indicates a suspension feeding biota existing on and within the interstices of coral-spongiomorph thickets, and inhabiting laterally adjacent substrates of peloidal carbonate sand. The bivalve fauna is ecologically congruent with the reef-dwelling molluscs associated with Middle Triassic sponge-coral buildups in the Cassian Formation of the Dolomites (Fuersich and Wendt, 1977). Hells Canyon is a particularly important early Norian locality because of the diversity of substrate types and because the site includes many first occurrences of bivalves in the North American Cordillera. These first occurrences include the first documentation of the important epifaunal families Pectinidae and Terquemiidae in Triassic rocks of the North American Cordillera.             The large number of biogeographic and geochronologic range extensions discovered in this single tropical Norian biota indicates that use of literature-based range data for Late Triassic bivalves may be very hazardous. Many bivalve taxa formerly thought to have gone extinct in Karnian time have now been documented from Norian strata in this arc terrane. These range extensions, coupled with the high bivalve species richness of the Hells Canyon site, suggest that the Karnian mass extinction in several literature-based compilations may be an artifact of incomplete sampling. Even for the Norian, present compilations of molluscan extinction may have an unacceptably large artifactual component.                            Thirty-five bivalve taxa from the Hells Canyon locality are discussed.

Here we examine the impact of dynamically changing iron deposition on tropical Pacific Ocean biogeochemistry in fully coupled earth system model projections under several emissions scenarios. Projected end‐of‐21st‐century increases in central tropical Pacific dust and iron deposition strengthen with increasing emissions/radiative forcing, and are aligned with projected soil moisture decreases in adjacent land areas and precipitation increases over the equatorial Pacific. Increased delivery of soluble iron results in a reduction in, and eastward contraction of, equatorial Pacific phytoplankton iron limitation and shifts primary production and particulate organic carbon flux projections relative to a high emissions projection (SSP5‐8.5) wherein soluble iron deposition is prescribed as a static climatology. These results highlight modeling advances in representing coupled land‐air‐sea interactions to project basin‐scale patterns of ocean biogeochemical change.           ,              Plain Language Summary             We use an Earth System Model (ESM) to explore climate‐driven changes in the deposition of dust and iron from the atmosphere to the ocean under a range of climate change scenarios. These simulations use a “dynamic” approach for iron deposition which means iron deposition is affected by changing atmospheric dust loads and factoring in wind and precipitation which affect dust and iron transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean. Under increasing climate change scenarios, GFDL's ESM4.1 projects drier soil conditions, as well as more dust in the atmosphere and precipitation over the Pacific Ocean toward the end of the 21st century. Elevated levels of future iron delivery to the ocean reduce iron limitation of phytoplankton growth in the central Pacific. As a result, we find higher levels of phytoplankton production in the central, equatorial Pacific but lower levels downstream in the western and off‐equatorial Pacific because other nutrients necessary for growth are depleted by reduced upwelling and enhanced production in the eastern Pacific. This geographic pattern also appears in the change in carbon sinking from the surface ocean to depth. Overall, these results highlight how ESM advances can improve our understanding of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems.           ,              Key Points                                                                Dynamically modeled atmosphere‐to‐ocean soluble iron deposition permits deposition driver variability to affect upper ocean biogeochemistry                                                     Tropical Pacific iron deposition increases with radiative forcing, affecting phytoplankton nutrient limitation, production, and POC flux                                                     Deposition increases align with soil moisture decreases in adjacent land areas, and precipitation increases over the equatorial Pacific","2023-11-16","2025-02-21 22:50:43","2025-02-21 22:50:43","2025-02-21 22:50:43","e2022GL102058","","21","50","","Geophysical Research Letters","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/J28F66WF/The Importance of Dynamic Iron Deposition in Proje - Drenkard et al. - 2023.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The importance of geographic patterns of diversification in shaping the                 LGR                 was assessed using three complementary approaches. First, we used the fossil record to evaluate the region of origination of genera (tropical vs. extra‐tropical). Secondly, we used a nestedness analysis to compare present‐day biogeographic distributions of genera with their region of origin. Finally, we evaluated the importance of biogeographic dynamics for shaping the                 LGR                 using a projection matrix and estimating transition probabilities among different biogeographic states.

Originations were similar in the tropics and extra‐tropics, a pattern that was robust to geographic differences in fossil sampling. The biogeographic distribution of genera was significantly nested, irrespective of the region of origin of genera. The distribution dynamics model accurately reproduced the                 LGR                 and showed that key‐transitions are low extinction in the tropics and high dispersal of taxa from the extra‐tropics to the tropics.

Only a few records are from localities in the large expanse of the central and southern Mexican Pacific. Thus, sabellids and serpulids were collected from several shallow water habitats along the coast of Mexican Pacific, such as coastal lagoons, coral reefs, rocky shores and from man-made structures as marinas, piers and ships of several harbors; additionally, specimens from national collections were revised. More than 8,400 specimens of sabellids and serpulids from the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, Sinaloa, Michoacán, Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas, and some specimens from Panamá and Perú were examined. In the present work we record new localities of four sabellids and 24 serpulids. One sabellid, Branchiomma bairdi, is an exotic/invasive species in Oaxaca, Sinaloa and Baja California Sur, while four species of serpulids are exotic and/or cryptogenic species: Ficopomatus uschakovi, Hydroides dirampha, H. elegans and H. sanctaecrucis. Additionally, the geographical range has been extended for five species: the sabellids Pseudobranchiomma punctata from Oahu, Hawaii to La Paz Bay, and Parasabella pallida from California to Puerto Escondido, Baja California Sur; and for three serpulids, Hydroides inermis from the Galápagos Islands to Agua Blanca, Oaxaca, H. gairacensis from Panamá to Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and H. panamensis from Panamá to Huatulco, Oaxaca and Faro de Bucerías, Michoacán.

This suggests that there are unidentified and unmeasured food sources reaching the seafloor. During 11 deep-sea remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys in the Gulf of California, the remains (squid carcasses and hatched-out egg sheets) of 64 post-brooding squid were encountered. As many as 36 remains were encountered during a single dive. To our knowledge this is one of the largest numbers of natural food falls of medium-size deep-sea nekton described to date. Various deep-sea scavengers (Ophiuroidea, Holothuroidea, Decapoda, Asteroidea, Enteropneusta) were associated with the remains. Although many of the 80 examined ROV dives did not encounter dead squids or egg sheets (               n               = 69), and the phenomenon may be geographically and temporally restricted, our results show that dead, sinking squid transport carbon from the water column to the seafloor in the Gulf of California. Based on food fall observations from individual dives, we estimate that annual squid carcass depositions may regionally contribute from 0.05 to 12.07 mg C m               −2               d               −1               to the seafloor in the areas where we observed the remains. The sinking of squid carcasses may constitute a significant but underestimated carbon vector between the water column and the seafloor worldwide, because squid populations are enormous and are regionally expanding as a result of climate change and pressure on fish stocks. In the future, standardized methods and surveys in geographical regions that have large squid populations will be important for investigating the overall contribution of squid falls to regional carbon budgets.","2017-12-20","2025-02-21 22:51:28","2025-02-21 22:51:28","2025-02-21 22:51:28","20172096","","1869","284","","Proc.

Roy               et al               . found that large‐bodied species of marine bivalves were more likely to be successful invaders, consistent with patterns seen during Pleistocene climatic change, but Miller               et al               . argued that such selectivity was largely driven by the inclusion of mariculture species in the analysis and that size‐selectivity was absent outside of mariculture introductions.

First, we test the hypothesis that larger bivalve species are more successful than small species in expanding their geographical ranges following introduction into new regions. Second, we compare body sizes of indigenous and non‐indigenous species for 299 of the 303 known intertidal and shelf species within the marine bivalve clade that contains the greater number of non‐mariculture invaders, the Mytilidae. The results from both tests provide additional support for the view that body size plays an important role in mediating invasion success in marine bivalves, in contrast to Miller               et al               .

The barnacle               Megabalanus coccopoma               is native to shorelines from Baja California to Peru and has been introduced to many locations worldwide, including the southeastern               USA               . The ability of larvae to develop successfully at local temperatures can be an important factor limiting the spread of invasive species. To determine if cold temperatures limited larval success near the northern range limit of               M. coccopoma               along the Atlantic southeastern               USA               coast, we measured lower temperature limits to larval development, examined the effects of temperature on larval growth and energy accumulation, and calculated a larval energy budget to estimate the extent of potential larval dispersal in this region. Larvae were able to develop through metamorphosis at 16°C, which is much colder than sea surface temperatures during the spawning season in their invasive range, making it unlikely northern range limits are set by a lower temperature limit to larval development. Energy budgets suggest that for larvae produced at the northern end of the invasive range, long distance dispersal to sites far poleward of the current range limit is possible. Similar to the findings of the handful of other studies on cold tolerances of tropical marine invertebrate larvae, larvae should be successful far poleward of current adult distributions.","2017-03","2025-02-21 22:51:31","2025-02-21 22:51:31","2025-02-21 22:51:31","37-49","","1","136","","Invertebrate Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Time Period               1968–2020.                                         Major Taxa Studied               Cephalopods and fishes (Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes).                                         Methods               We map the biomass of cephalopods and their traits across marine shelves using scientific bottom trawl survey data from the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific. We further map global fisheries catch. We apply statistical methods to evaluate how temperature, zooplankton productivity and depth drive these patterns.                                         Results               Cephalopods represent a small fraction (1%) of the combined fish and cephalopod biomass on continental shelves. However, their distribution displays a high regional heterogeneity, with some areas being virtually absent of cephalopods and other areas accounting for up to 24% of total biomass. Higher temperatures and zooplankton productivity are associated with increased cephalopod biomass and proportional biomass relative to fish. The largest cephalopods are found in the Northeast Pacific. Growth rates are highest in warmer waters with fastest growth rates found in lower latitudes of the North Atlantic. Cephalopods constitute 5% of the combined fish and cephalopod global fisheries catch. This proportion varies across regions. Higher temperature and zooplankton productivity are associated with increased cephalopod catch relative to fish.                                         Main Conclusions               Temperature and productivity shape the large‐scale biogeography of cephalopods and their traits on marine shelves. The relations with temperature suggest that future warming could lead to a proliferation of fast‐growing cephalopods in cold and temperate systems, with implications for ecosystem dynamics and fisheries. Despite a relatively low observed biomass, cephalopods hold substantial potential to change ecosystem structure and functioning given their high energy lifestyle.","2024-03","2025-02-21 22:51:35","2025-02-21 22:51:35","2025-02-21 22:51:35","439-449","","3","33","","Global Ecol Biogeogr","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/VIM7E2DJ/Biomass and trait biogeography of cephalopods on t - Ottmann et al. - 2024.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we use the subtidal horse mussel (               Modiolus modiolus               ) to investigate whether generalizations about genetic structure of high latititude intertidal species, specifically in the North Atlantic, are representative of other near shore taxa. We analysed genetic diversity, molecular variance, and geographical patterns of genetic relatedness using data from the mtDNA CO1 gene. Although we do find little to no haplotype structure in the North Atlantic, our results show that north-eastern Pacific individuals represent a different haplotype network with no haplotypes in common with Atlantic individuals. Thus,               M. modiolus               in the Pacific may represent an unrecognized species. Genetic diversity and population expansion times suggest a Pacific origin is most likely, with subsequent dispersal to the Atlantic.

Little is known about the mechanisms that have shaped the geographical distribution of genetic diversity in marine species present on the south‐eastern Pacific (SEP) coast. Here we provide the first comprehensive phylogeographical study of a species distributed along the SEP coast by analysing the endemic and emblematic muricid gastropod               Concholepas concholepas               .                                         Location                The study localities were distributed along the SEP coast ranging from Matarani (11° S) to Puerto Eden (49° S), crossing three major biogeographical provinces: Peruvian Province, Intermediate Area and Magellanic Province.                                         Methods                A total of 337 specimens of               C. concholepas               were collected from 14 localities in the three biogeographical provinces/areas. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene partial sequences (658 bp) were obtained and analysed using coalescence‐based methods to infer molecular diversity and phylogeographical patterns.                                         Results                Across the 337 individuals, we found a large diversity, with a total of 179 haplotypes at the COI gene fragment. Although a slight decrease in gene diversity was observed from north to south, an analysis of molecular variance did not reveal any significant spatial population differentiation from Peru to the tip of Chile, not even across the recognized biogeographical boundaries at 30° S and 42° S. In addition, a star‐like haplotype network suggested the past occurrence of a rapid demographic and geographical expansion over the total range examined. Calculations of the onset of this expansion suggest that it might be due to climatic conditions during the period of the marine isotope stage 11 (MIS 11, 400,000 years ago), the longer and warmer interglacial episode during the Pleistocene epoch.                                         Main conclusions                Our phylogeographical analyses indicate that in the recent past               C. concholepas               mitochondrial DNA lineages underwent a sudden population expansion event. In addition, our data do not support the hypothesis of concordance between biogeographical barriers and phylogeographical breaks along the SEP coast. These two results are in accordance with the paradigm of high larval dispersal ability in marine species with an extended pelagic larval phase.","2009-05","2025-02-21 22:51:39","2025-02-21 22:51:39","2025-02-21 22:51:39","969-981","","5","36","","Journal of Biogeography","A phylogeographical analysis across three biogeographical provinces of the south‐eastern Pacific","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, little is known about species ranges, since most descriptions are from single localities. In this study, we used new sampling in the north-eastern Pacific and available GenBank data from off Japan and Brazil to report expanded ranges for five species:               Osedax frankpressi               ,               O. knutei               ,               O. packardorum               ,               O. roseus               and               O. talkovici               . We also provided additional DNA sequences from previously reported localities for two species:               Osedax priapus               and               O. randyi               .

This study examined the combined effects of climate change on the yellowfin tuna population using the ecosystem model SEAPODYM. Yellowfin tuna fisheries in the Pacific contribute significantly to the economies and food security of Pacific Island Countries and Territories and Oceania. We use an ensemble of earth climate models to project yellowfin populations under a high greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC RCP8.5) scenario, which includes, the combined effects of a warming ocean, increasing acidification and changing ocean chemistry. Our results suggest that the acidification impact will be smaller in comparison to the ocean warming impact, even in the most extreme ensemble member scenario explored, but will have additional influences on yellowfin tuna population dynamics. An eastward shift in the distribution of yellowfin tuna was observed in the projections in the model ensemble in the absence of explicitly accounting for changes in acidification. The extent of this shift did not substantially differ when the three-acidification induced larval mortality scenarios were included in the ensemble; however, acidification was projected to weaken the magnitude of the increase in abundance in the eastern Pacific. Together with intensive fishing, these potential changes are likely to challenge the global fishing industry as well as the economies and food systems of many small Pacific Island Countries and Territories. The modelling framework applied in this study provides a tool for evaluating such effects and informing policy development.","2022-04-22","2025-02-21 22:51:53","2025-02-21 22:51:53","2025-02-21 22:51:53","816772","","","9","","Front.

The survey included daily sampling by the staff and a number of visiting taxonomists with specialties covering all the major groups of invertebrates. Many marine habitats were sampled: rocky and sand/gravel intertidal and tidepools, eelgrass meadows, shallow and deeper subtidal by snorkel and Scuba, plus artificial surfaces including the sides and bottom of the large floating dock at the Institute and settlement plates set out up to a year previously at various subtidal sites. Many new species were recorded by all the taxonomists. In this very biodiverse remote area 36 ascidian species were identified: 18 Aplousobranchia, 7 Phlebobranchia, and 11 Stolidobranchia, comprising a total of 15 solitary and 21 colonial species including two undescribed colonial species. This represents almost one third of all the known North American species from Alaska to southern California in this limited very remote area. Remarkably, only two are possible non-natives. Diplosoma listerianum (Milne-Edwards, 1841), was collected mostly on natural substrates including deeper areas sampled by Scuba, and one colony occurred on a settlement plate. A few Ciona savignyi Herdman, 1882 were collected, two from natural substrates and four from artificial surfaces. There were no botryllids, Styela clava Herdman, 1881, Didemnum vexillum Kott, 2002, or Molgula manhattensis (De Kay, 1843), though these are all common and sometimes very abundant non-natives in other parts of BC and along much of the U.S. west coast.

The abundance and distribution of the species are highly susceptible to fluctuations in marine environmental conditions. The evolution of mesoscale eddies represents one of the dynamic processes in the ocean, exerting varying degrees of influence on regional biogeochemical processes from generation to dissipation. However, the mechanisms governing the regulation of abundance and spatial distribution of D. gigas off Peru during this evolution remain unclear. Therefore, this study employed normalization techniques and the habitat suitability index (HSI) model, utilizing data from the D. gigas fishery, mesoscale eddies, and marine environmental factors (including sea surface temperature, temperature at 50 m depth, and chlorophyll-a concentration) to analyze the environmental changes and the abundance, spatial distribution, and habitat changes of D. gigas during the evolution of mesoscale eddies. The results indicate that eddies undergo four stages: formation, intensification, maturity, and decay. During eddy evolution, the abundance of D. gigas exhibited an initial increase and a subsequent decrease within cyclonic eddies (CEs), whereas, within anticyclonic eddies (AEs), abundance showed a gradual decline. The outcome of the HSI model revealed that, the habitat suitability and the proportion of suitable habitat areas within eddies were highly consistent with the abundance of D. gigas during all stages of the eddies other than the intensification stage of AEs. The study speculated that both CEs and AEs can create favorable environmental conditions during the maturity stage, thereby leading to an increase in suitable habitat and abundance of D. gigas. These findings emphasize the significant impact of mesoscale eddy evolution on the abundance and habitat distribution of D. gigas.","2024-06-18","2025-02-21 22:52:08","2025-02-21 22:52:08","2025-02-21 22:52:08","1015","","6","12","","JMSE","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/IR89ITZ8/Spatial Distribution and Abundance of a Pelagic Sq - Wu et al. - 2024.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To examine the relative importance of these factors in shaping the current population structure of               Littorina keenae               , we sequenced 762 base pairs of the mitochondrial ND6 and cytochrome               b               genes in 584 snails from 13 sites along the northeastern Pacific coast. Haplotype network analysis revealed a ‘star‐like’ genealogy indicative of a recent population expansion. Nested clade and mismatch analyses also supported the hypothesis of sudden population expansion following a population bottleneck during the Last Glacial Maximum. Analysis of molecular variance and pairwise Φ               ST               showed no significant spatial population differentiation from Mexico to Oregon – not even across the recognized biogeographic boundary at Point Conception. This is probably due to high contemporary gene flow during the free‐swimming larval stage of this snail. Surprisingly, we found a highly significant temporal population differentiation between a San Pedro sample from 1996 and one from 2005, which gave an estimate of effective population size (               N               e               ) of only 135. Nearly statistically significant changes in the frequency of a particular haplotype in three other populations over 2–3 years further support Hedgecock's ‘sweepstakes’ hypothesis. When by chance nearly all of the progeny from an aggregation of highly fecund sisters that possess a rare haplotype successfully recruit to become the next generation, the rare haplotype can become temporarily common across the entire species’ range. This modification of the sweepstakes hypothesis can explain why the temporal variation that we observed was much greater than the spatial variation.","2007-08","2025-02-21 22:52:14","2025-02-21 22:52:14","2025-02-21 22:52:14","3084-3103","","15","16","","Molecular Ecology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paradigm holds that where sea otters occur herbivores are rare and plants are abundant, whereas when sea otters are absent herbivores are relatively common and plants are rare. Spatial patterns were based on 20 randomly placed quadrats at 153 randomly selected sites distributed among five locations with and four locations without sea otters. Both sea urchin and kelp abundance differed significantly among locations with vs. without sea otters in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska. There was little (Aleutian Islands) or no (southeast Alaska) overlap between sites with and without sea otters, in plots of kelp density against urchin biomass. Despite intersite variation in the abundance of kelps and herbivores, these analyses demonstrate that sea otter predation has a predictable and broadly generalizable influence on the structure of Alaskan kelp forests. The percent cover of algal turf and suspension feeder assemblages also differed significantly (although less dramatically) between locations with and without sea otters. Temporal variation in community structure was assessed over periods of from 3 to 15 yr at sites in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska where sea otters were 1) continuously present, 2) continuously absent, or 3) becoming reestablished because of natural range expansion. Kelp and sea urchin abundance remained largely unchanged at most sites where sea otters were continuously present or absent, the one exception being at Torch Bay (southeast Alaska), where kelp abundance varied significantly through time and urchin abundance varied significantly among sites because of episodic and patchy disturbances. In contrast, kelp and sea urchin abundances changed significantly, and in the expected directions, at sites that were being recolonized by sea otters. Sea urchin biomass declined by 50% in the Aleutian Islands and by nearly 100% in southeast Alaska following the spread of sea otters into previously unoccupied habitats. In response to these different rates and magnitudes of urchin reduction by sea otter predation, increases in kelp abundance were abrupt and highly significant in southeast Alaska but much smaller and slower over similar time periods in the Aleutian Islands. The different kelp colonization rates between southeast Alaska and the Aleutian Islands appear to be caused by large—scale differences in echinoid recruitment coupled with size—selective predation by sea otters for larger urchins. The length of urchin jaws (correlated with test diameter, r               2               = 0.968) in sea otter scats indicates that sea urchins <15—20 mm test diameter are rarely eaten by foraging sea otters. Sea urchin populations in the Aleutian Islands included high densities of small individuals (<20 mm test diameter) at all sites and during all years sampled, whereas in southeast Alaska similarly sized urchins were absent from most populations during most years. Small (<30—35 mm test diameter) tetracycline—marked urchins in the Aleutian Islands grew at a maximum rate of °10 mm/yr; thus the population must have significant recruitment annually, or at least every several years. In contrast, echinoid recruitment in southeast Alaska was more episodic, with many years to perhaps decades separating significant events. Our findings help explain regional differences in recovery rates of kelp forests following recolonization by sea otters.","1995-02","2025-02-21 22:52:32","2025-02-21 22:52:32","2025-02-21 22:52:32","75-100","","1","65","","Ecological Monographs","Sea Otters and Kelp Forests in Alaska","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study species,               Drosophila montana               , represents the northern insect species where flies enter reproductive diapause under short day conditions and where the precise timing of diapause is crucial for both survival and offspring production. We have studied clinal variation in the critical day length for female diapause induction (CDL) and their overall susceptibility to enter diapause (diapause incidence), as well as the temperature sensitivity of these traits. The study was performed using multiple strains from four latitudinal clines of the species – short clines in Finland and Alaska and long clines in the Rocky Mountains and the western coast of North America – and from one population in Kamchatka, Russia. CDL showed strong latitudinal clines on both continents, decreasing by one hour per five degrees decline in latitude, on average. CDL also decreased in all populations along with an increase in fly rearing temperature postponing the diapause to later calendar time, the effects of temperature being stronger in southern than in northern population. Female diapause incidence was close to 100% under short day/low temperature conditions in all populations, but decreased below 50% even under short days in 19°C in the southern North American western coast populations and in 22°C in most populations. Comparing a diversity of climatic data for the studied populations showed that while CDL is under a tight photoperiodic regulation linked with latitude, its length depends also on climatic factors determining the growing season length. Overall, the study deepens our understanding of how spatial and environmental parameters affect the seasonal timing of an important biological event, reproductive diapause and helps to estimate the evolutionary potential of insect populations to survive in changing climatic conditions.","2020-05","2025-02-21 22:52:37","2025-02-21 22:52:37","2025-02-21 22:52:37","759-768","","5","43","","Ecography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/CQGY94R9/Latitudinal clines in the timing and temperature‐s - Tyukmaeva et al. - 2020.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As originally expounded, the phylogeographic hypotheses are generalities that have limited discriminatory power; the goal of this study is to generate and test specific instances of the hypotheses, thereby better elucidating both local patterns of evolution and the conditions under which the generalities do or do not apply.                                         Location                Coastal south‐east Australia (New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria), and south‐west North America (California and Baja California).                                         Methods                Phylogeographic hypotheses specific to coastal south‐east Australia were generated               a priori               , principally from existing detailed distributional analyses of echinoderms and decapods. The hypotheses are tested using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) DNA sequence data describing population variation in the jellyfish               Catostylus mosaicus,               integrated with comparable data from the literature.                                         Results                Mitochondrial COI distinguished two reciprocally monophyletic clades of               C. mosaicus               (mean ± SD: 3.61 ± 0.40% pairwise sequence divergence) that were also differentiated by ITS1 haplotype frequency differences; the boundary between the clades was geographically proximate to a provincial zoogeographic boundary in the vicinity of Bass Strait. There was also limited evidence of another genetic inhomogeneity, of considerably smaller magnitude, in close proximity to a second hypothesized zoogeographic discontinuity near Sydney. Other coastal marine species also show genetic divergences in the vicinity of Bass Strait, although they are not closely concordant with each other or with reported biogeographic discontinuities in the region, being up to several hundreds of kilometres apart. None of the species studied to date show a strong phylogeographic discontinuity across the biogeographic transition zone near Sydney.                                         Main conclusions                Patterns of evolution in the Bass Strait and coastal New South Wales regions differ fundamentally because of long‐term differences in extrinsic factors. Since the late Pliocene, periods of cold climate and low sea‐level segregated warm temperate organisms east or west of an emergent Bassian Isthmus resulting in population divergence and speciation; during subsequent periods of warmer and higher seas, sister taxa expanded into the Bass Strait region leading to weakly correlated phylogeographic and biogeographic patterns. The Sydney region, by contrast, has been more consistently favourable to shifts in species’ ranges and long‐distance movement, resulting in a lack of intra‐specific and species‐level diversification. Comparisons between the Sydney and Bass Strait regions and prior studies in North America suggest that vicariance plays a key role in generating coastal biodiversity and that dispersal explains many of the deviations from the phylogeographic hypotheses.","2005-03","2025-02-21 22:52:41","2025-02-21 22:52:41","2025-02-21 22:52:41","515-533","","3","32","","Journal of Biogeography","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/B9QFWPUI/Incipient speciation of Catostylus mosaicus - Dawson - 2005.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pleuroncodes planipes               are usually abundant off Baja California, Mexico, and their appearance in central California is thought to coincide with anomalously warm waters and northward advection related to El Niño. This anecdotal association has stimulated many hypotheses, but no hypothesis has gained clear and convincing support. Motivated by an unprecedented number of               P. planipes               strandings and at‐sea observations in 2015–2019, we compiled 10               P. planipes               datasets spanning 1950–2019, tested the anomalous advection hypothesis using a transport analysis from 1981 to 2010, and explored other compelling hypotheses. We found               P. planipes               presence off central California was related to anomalous advection of waters from Mexico, sometimes but not always associated with El Niño events, with               P. planipes               likely remaining residents of northern waters for several years without additional anomalous transport but potentially facilitated by warm waters. By identifying a mechanism behind episodic               P. planipes               range expansions, we show that a source water index could provide an early indicator for anomalous events in the future.","2021-08","2025-02-21 22:52:43","2025-02-21 22:52:43","2025-02-21 22:52:43","3176-3189","","8","66","","Limnology & Oceanography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/U9PW6R63/Anomalous poleward advection facilitates episodic - Cimino et al. - 2021.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed size‐fractionated mesozooplankton biomass (>200               μ               m) from biweekly to monthly day and night tows taken from 1994 to 2010 in the epipelagic zone at the Bermuda Atlantic Time series Study (BATS) site in the oligotrophic North Atlantic subtropical gyre. During this 17‐year period total mesozooplankton biomass increased 61% overall, although a few short‐term downturns occurred over the course of the time series. The overall increase was higher in the nighttime compared to daytime, resulting in an increase in calculated diel vertical migrator biomass. The largest seasonal increase in total biomass was in the late‐winter to spring (February–April). Associated with the larger increase in late‐winter/spring biomass was a shift in the timing of annual peak biomass during the latter half of the time series (from March/April to a distinct March peak for all size fractions combined, and April to March for the 2–5 mm size fractions). Zooplankton biomass was positively correlated with sea‐surface temperature, water column stratification, and primary production, and negatively correlated with mean temperature between 300 and 600 m. Significant correlations exist between multidecadal climate indices–the North Atlantic Oscillation plus three different Pacific Ocean climate indices, and BATS zooplankton biomass, indicating connections between patterns in climate forcing and ecosystem response. Resultant changes in biogeochemical cycling include an increase in the magnitude of both active carbon flux by diel vertical migration and passive carbon flux of fecal pellets as components of the export flux. The most likely mechanism driving the zooplankton biomass increase is bottom‐up control by smaller phytoplankton, which has also increased in biomass and production at BATS, translating up the microbial food web into mesozooplankton. Decreases in top‐down control or expansion of the range of tropical species northward as a result of warming may also play a role.                        ,              Key Points                                                                There is a long‐term (16 year) increase in BATS mesozooplankton biomass                                                     The zooplankton increase seems to be controlled by increased primary production                                                     The zooplankton increase has led to changes in biogeochemical cycling","2012-03","2025-02-21 22:52:47","2025-02-21 22:52:47","2025-02-21 22:52:47","2010GB004026","","1","26","","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","Long‐term increase in mesozooplankton biomass in the Sargasso Sea","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We determined the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of O. hubbsorum by using mtDNA sequences (COI and ND5). The population structure was not supported by AMOVA or a spatial clustering model. Furthermore, an isolation by distance model did not explain our data. Three haplogroups were detected using a Bayesian assignment; however, the distribution of these haplogroups did not differ among the sampling sites. Our results indicated historical processes of a sudden population expansion, as has been reported for other species in the study region as consequence of climatic changes. However, this expansion did not affect the distribution of the mitochondrial lineages analysed in the study. The weak population genetic structure in O. hubbsorum associated with the life history of the species can explain our results. We suggest that to expand knowledge regarding the genetic structure and population dynamics of O. hubbsorum throughout its range, markers such as microsatellites or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are needed. Thus, on the basis of the information available, the studied population should be assumed to have a weak genetic structure.","2021","2025-02-21 22:52:55","2025-02-21 22:52:55","2025-02-21 22:52:55","35","","1","72","","Mar.

Here, we used distributional and genetic data to document the consequences of tropicalisation in rocky shore gastropods and assess more broadly the future implications of tropicalisation on phylogeographic patterns.

Methods                                We determine historical and modern distributions of tropical and temperate species by combining historical records with current field surveys. Using a section of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene, we utilised comparative phylogeography, analysis of molecular variance,                 F                 ST                 pairwise comparison, mismatch distributions of haplotype differences and neutrality tests to detect genetic signatures of tropicalisation and to better understand its consequences.                                                        Results                                We identified range contractions in two temperate species and range expansion in all three tropical species. We detected genetic signatures of range expansion in the tropical species through unimodal distributions of pairwise haplotype differences and strongly negative values for the Fu and Li                 D                 and                 F                 * statistics. We found population subdivision and phylogeographic breaks in three temperate species, although the geographic location of the breaks differed among species.                                                        Main Conclusions               Genetic signatures and field surveys indicate recent range expansions in tropical species, supporting tropicalisation along the studied coastline. Conversely, we found phylogeographic breaks in temperate species, suggesting that tropicalisation may cause genetic erosion of evolutionary distinct lineages with range‐contraction. The different locations of the phylogeographic breaks among temperate species suggests that some barriers are species specific.                        ,              RESUMEN                            Objetivo               La expansión del área de distribución hacia los polos de especies tropicales y la contracción del área de distribución de especies de zonas templadas (conocidas como el proceso de tropicalización), se ha estudiado principalmente desde una perspectiva ecológica, mientras que poco se sabe sobre sus consecuencias genéticas.

En contraste, se encontraron quiebres filogeográficos en las especies con afinidad templada, lo que sugiere que la tropicalización puede causar erosión genética de los distintos linajes evolutivos con una contracción del rango de distribución. Las diferentes ubicaciones de los quiebres filogeográficos entre las especies con afinidad templada sugiere que existen algunas barreras específicas.","2024-02","2025-02-21 22:52:58","2025-02-21 22:52:58","2025-02-21 22:52:58","246-262","","2","51","","Journal of Biogeography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/PUIKS3NK/Opposing genetic patterns of range shifting temper - Zarzyczny et al. - 2024.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nitrate, both during spring runoff and during growing seasons, declined from 1983 through 1995. Declining snowmelt nitrate was caused primarily by changes in snow regime induced by the 1987–1992 drought: years with shallow, early melting snowpacks had lower snowmelt nitrate concentrations owing to less labile N production in catchment soils and longer plant growing seasons. However, nitrate declines during growing seasons carried through the wetter years of 1993–2000 and are likely the result of increased P loading to the lake and the release of phytoplankton from P limitation. Contemporaneous with these changes was an increase in algal biomass and a shift from P limitation toward more frequent N limitation of phytoplankton abundance. Particulate carbon concentrations in the late 1990s were two‐ to threefold greater than in the early 1980s. These trends were reflected in a larger set of Sierra Nevada lakes sampled as part of synoptic surveys (n = 28). Between 1985 and 1999, nitrate decreased and total P increased in .>0% of the lakes sampled. Our data suggest that lakes throughout the Sierra Nevada are experiencing measurable eutrophication in response to the atmospheric deposition of nutrients.","2003-09","2025-02-21 22:53:12","2025-02-21 22:53:12","2025-02-21 22:53:12","1885-1892","","5","48","","Limnology & Oceanography","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/EXIURYUQ/Evidence for nutrient enrichment of high‐elevation - Sickman et al. - 2003.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results                                Simulation results indicated that species' habitat suitability increased or remained the same in the northern and southern margins of the Eastern Tropical Pacific but decreased by up to 14% in some fisheries along Central America. The largest declines in the average species habitat suitability index were projected for small pelagic fisheries (up to −46%), while the highest local species turnover was projected for coastal small‐scale fisheries (up to 80%). Under RCP 8.5, species in the southern half and northern equatorial region of the Eastern Tropical Pacific were projected to shift south‐east at a rate of approximately 30–60 km decade                 ‐1                 , respectively.

Tentatively identified in previous works as Distaplia cf. stylifera, a precise taxonomic determination was still lacking. In the present work, based on a detailed morphological study, it is confirmed that this aggressive species is               Distaplia stylifera               (Kowalevsky, 1874). Originally described from the Red Sea, the species currently has a wide circumtropical distribution (with the exception of the Eastern Pacific to date) and is reported as introduced in parts of its range. The present account thus represents an important range extension of this species. However, when revising the original description and later observations, the reported variability of several characters makes it likely that the binomen is in fact a complex of species, as is common in other ascidians with wide distributions. A complete morphological and genetic study including populations from the entire range of distribution would be necessary to settle the status of               D. stylifera               . Taxonomic uncertainties hinder a correct interpretation of biogeographical patterns and inference on the origin of the studied population. Nevertheless, the known introduction potential of the species, coupled with an explosive growth in an anthropized environment, and the lack of any previous reports in the Eastern Pacific, strongly suggest that the investigated population represents yet another instance of ascidian introduction. From the point of view of management, its invasive behavior is cause for great concern and warrants mitigation measures.","2023-04-05","2025-02-21 22:53:23","2025-02-21 22:53:23","2025-02-21 22:53:23","109-125","","","1157","","ZK","","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/EL3NRADS/Taxonomic identity of Distaplia stylifera (Tunicat - Moreno-Dávila et al. - 2023.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These metal‐rich environments are coveted for the mineral resources they harbour, thus raising recent conservation concerns. The evolutionary fate and demographic resilience of hydrothermal species strongly depend on the degree of connectivity among and within their fragmented metapopulations. In the deep sea, however, assessing connectivity is difficult and usually requires indirect genetic approaches. Improved detection of fine‐scale genetic connectivity is now possible based on genome‐wide screening for genetic differentiation. Here, we explored population connectivity in the hydrothermal vent snail               Ifremeria nautilei               across its species range encompassing five distinct back‐arc basins in the Southwest Pacific. The global analysis, based on 10,570 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from double digest restriction‐site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD‐seq), depicted two semi‐isolated and homogeneous genetic clusters. Demogenetic modeling suggests that these two groups began to diverge about 70,000 generations ago, but continue to exhibit weak and slightly asymmetrical gene flow. Furthermore, a careful analysis of outlier loci showed subtle limitations to connectivity between neighbouring basins within both groups. This finding indicates that migration is not strong enough to totally counterbalance drift or local selection, hence questioning the potential for demographic resilience at this latter geographical scale. These results illustrate the potential of large genomic data sets to understand fine‐scale connectivity patterns in hydrothermal vents and the deep sea.","2022-05","2025-02-21 22:53:34","2025-02-21 22:53:34","2025-02-21 22:53:34","2796-2813","","10","31","","Molecular Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/G257XB5G/Subtle limits to connectivity revealed by outlier - Tran Lu Y et al. - 2022.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By using an animal-borne video package, National Geographic's Crittercam, we were able to observe natural behaviors in free-swimming D. gigas in the Gulf of California with a focus on color-generating (chromogenic) behaviors. We documented two dynamic displays without artificial lighting at depths of up to 70 m. One dynamic pattern, termed ‘flashing' is characterized by a global oscillation (2–4 Hz) of body color between white and red. Flashing was almost always observed when other squid were visible in the video frame, and this behavior presumably represents intraspecific signaling. Amplitude and frequency of flashing can be modulated, and the phase relationship with another squid can also be rapidly altered. Another dynamic display termed ‘flickering’ was observed whenever flashing was not occurring. This behavior is characterized by irregular wave-like activity in neighboring patches of chromatophores, and the resulting patterns mimic reflections of down-welled light in the water column, suggesting that this behavior may provide a dynamic type of camouflage. Rapid and global pauses in flickering, often before a flashing episode, indicate that flickering is under inhibitory neural control. Although flashing and flickering have not been described in other squid, functional similarities are evident with other species.","2015-01-15","2025-02-21 22:53:37","2025-02-21 22:53:37","2025-02-21 22:53:37","265-275","","2","218","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/2TDZEE2U/Chromogenic behaviors of the Humboldt squid ( D - Rosen et al. - 2015.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These expansions are particularly noteworthy because cephalopods are a taxon of quickly reproducing, high-metabolic rate predators that can have disproportionate impacts on naïve ecosystems. We report a new occurrence of an octopus species in 11.6 m of water in Burrows Bay, Washington, USA (coastal northeast Pacific Ocean). These newly identified individuals have several characteristics that clearly differentiate them from either of the two known octopus species that occur in shallow water within the area:               Octopus rubescens               and               Enteroctopus dofleini               . Instead, specimens superficially resemble               Muusoctopus leioderma               , a species which is found in the geographic area, but has never been reported at depths less than 70 m. Octopuses were collected for morphological and genetic comparison to known octopus species, focusing on other nominal               Muusoctopus               species. Genetic comparisons were conducted using three mitochondrial loci (12S ribosomal RNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit III, and cytochrome b) sequenced for the octopus along with two               M. leioderma               museum specimens, including the species' neotype. Observation of octopus behaviour revealed a unique burrowing behaviour. Morphology of the octopus found in Burrows Bay largely coincides with               M. leioderma               , with a few notable differences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Burrows Bay octopus forms a monophyletic clade with the               M. leioderma               neotype, but also suggested that               M. leioderma               is more closely related to               Octopus californicus               than to the other members of the genus               Muusoctopus.

The fishery is of concern because of high harvest levels and potential indirect impacts of sheephead removals on the structure and function of kelp forest ecosystems. California sheephead are protogynous hermaphrodites that, as predators of sea urchins and other invertebrates, are critical components of kelp forest ecosystems in the northeast Pacific. Overfishing can trigger trophic cascades and widespread ecological dysfunction when other urchin predators are also lost from the system. Little is known about the ecology and abundance of sheephead before commercial exploitation. Lack of a historical perspective creates a gap for evaluating fisheries management measures and marine reserves that seek to rebuild sheephead populations to historical baseline conditions. We use population abundance and size structure data from the zooarchaeological record, in concert with isotopic data, to evaluate the long-term health and viability of sheephead fisheries in southern California. Our results indicate that the importance of sheephead to the diet of native Chumash people varied spatially across the Channel Islands, reflecting modern biogeographic patterns. Comparing ancient (~10,000 calibrated years before the present to 1825 CE) and modern samples, we observed variability and significant declines in the relative abundance of sheephead, reductions in size frequency distributions, and shifts in the dietary niche between ancient and modern collections. These results highlight how size-selective fishing can alter the ecological role of key predators and how zooarchaeological data can inform fisheries management by establishing historical baselines that aid future conservation.","2017-02-03","2025-02-21 22:53:48","2025-02-21 22:53:48","2025-02-21 22:53:48","e1601759","","2","3","","Sci.

Pyrosomes are common in tropical and sub-tropical ocean waters, but little is known about their abundance, distribution, and trophic ecology in mid-latitude systems. To assess these factors, pyrosomes were collected during cruises in the NCC in May and August 2017. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to identify relationships between               in situ               environmental variables (temperature, salinity, fluorescence) and distribution and abundance patterns of pyrosomes in May 2017. Fatty acid (FA) profiles were then characterized as diet indicators, and bulk stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen was used to examine spatial variations in potential food sources and trophic level. The GAM identified sea surface temperature and surface salinity as significant variables related to pyrosome densities. The most abundant FA in the pyrosomes was docosahexanoic acid (22:6ω3), which serves in pelagic systems as a biomarker for dinoflagellates. Common FA biomarkers for bacteria, carnivory, and dinoflagellates differed by latitude, suggesting that pyrosomes have different diets over a broad latitudinal range. The δ               15               N values of               P. atlanticum               indicate that pyrosomes may be feeding at a relatively low trophic level compared to other zooplankton groups in this region. Offshore pyrosomes had lower δ               13               C values than those collected on the shelf, suggesting incorporation of nearshore carbon in pyrosome tissues. Previously documented rapid reproduction and growth of pyrosomes coupled with efficient feeding behavior for common NCC plankters may support their continued presence in this mid-latitude region.","2020-10-01","2025-02-21 22:53:58","2025-02-21 22:53:58","2025-02-21 22:53:58","97-110","","","651","","Mar.

Seasonal surveys were conducted during 1998–1999 in the state of Baja California to determine the extent and activities of the artisanal elasmobranch fishery along its Gulf of California coast. Artisanal fishermen were highly opportunistic, and temporally switched targets depending on the local abundance of teleost, invertebrate, and elasmobranch fisheries resources. At least 17 species of shark, 13 species of ray, and 2 species of skate were identified among the 4495 specimens observed. Small, coastal sharks and rays were typically landed with bottom set gillnets during all surveyed seasons (spring–autumn) and large sharks were targeted with surface set (drift) gillnets during summer and autumn. Sharks and rays contributed similarly to elasmobranch landings, comprising 50.9% and 48.3%, respectively, of the total recorded catch. Overall landings were dominated by mustelid sharks (Mustelus henlei, Mustelus spp.) and the shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), with Alopias pelagicus, Gymnura spp., Heterodontus mexicanus, Mobula munkiana, Myliobatis californica, and Squatina californica also representing important components of the landings. Alopias vulpinus had previously been unreported for the Gulf of California and a new maximum size record was documented for Myliobatis longirostris. Catch rates (mean elasmobranchs/vessel/trip ± standard error) were lowest during autumn (17.4 ± 3.9) and highest in spring (35.3 ± 14.1). Adult, commonly gravid, A. pelagicus, Carcharhinus falciformis, and R. productus females comprised a disproportionately greater component of the landings than did their male counterparts. Given the decades of largely unrestricted exploitation of elasmobranchs in Mexican waters, population declines and shifts in size structure are likely to have occurred among those species with the lowest fecundity and latest ages at maturity.","2009-06-09","2025-02-21 22:54:00","2025-02-21 22:54:00","2025-02-21 22:54:00","209-236","","2","35","","Cienc.

This included ponds where phytoplankton nutrient limitation was examined in 1971–1973 as part of the International Biological Program (                     IBP                     ), as well as ponds in a remote protected area and others near the village of Barrow.                                                                                             Nutrient limitation status of phytoplankton has changed since the original                     IBP                     study 40 years ago from P limitation to                     NP                     co‐limitation. One‐third of regional phytoplankton enrichment experiments indicated no nutrient limitation of algal growth, and none exhibited single‐nutrient P limitation. This shift in nutrient limitation was coincident with increased water column nutrients due to degrading permafrost, and to the expansion into the ponds of macrophytes, which may compete with algae for available nitrogen.                                                                                             A comparison of pelagic and benthic experiments across the landscape revealed differences among these zones with a predominance of                     NP                     limitation of phytoplankton and absence of nutrient limitation in the benthic zone, reflecting contrasting nutrient limitation status within the same ponds. Permafrost thaw is probably reintroducing previously frozen stores of P or N to the sediment surface, which are quickly taken up by periphyton but become limited in the water column. Grazing by invertebrates, which were not excluded from the benthic assays, may also have influenced the results.                                                                                             While ponds within the village of Barrow had higher nutrient and algae levels, there was no obvious effect of urban development on nutrient limitation status, nor did development appear to have influenced the historic                     IBP                     pond sites.","2015-10","2025-02-21 22:54:09","2025-02-21 22:54:09","2025-02-21 22:54:09","2169-2186","","10","60","","Freshwater Biology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Brazilian slipper lobster, Scyllarides brasiliensis, is one of the most commercially important slipper lobster species in South America. We investigated, for the first time, the population genetic structure and evolutionary history of this species. Analyses of sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) and the control region (CR) did not reveal any significant genetic structure of S. brasiliensis (N = 202) along 2700 km of the Atlantic coast (COI: ΦST = 0.0004, ΦCT = 0–0.005, P > 0.05; CR: ΦST = 0.004, ΦCT = 0–0.029, P > 0.05). The genetic homogeneity found suggests high levels of gene flow along the area that are possibly related to the high dispersal potential of the planktonic larvae of the species. Furthermore, the data indicate that demographic and geographical expansions of this slipper lobster population have occurred during the late and middle Pleistocene, which could be related to the fluctuating environmental conditions of that period.","2014","2025-02-21 22:54:20","2025-02-21 22:54:20","2025-02-21 22:54:20","59","","1","65","","Mar.

Establishing the identity of geoduck clams and their distribution limits is not only of clear biological significance to understand their structural and functional variation, but is also of consequence for their conservation and management, given the multi-million dollar fishery they support in north-west Mexico. We analysed               Panopea               clams from Mexican populations, including BM, using an integrative approach including genetics, morphometrics, and an ecological niche model. Our genetic results (restriction fragment length polymorphisms of nuclear ribosomal DNA and mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences) clearly identify BM geoducks as               P. globosa               , implying a significant geographical range expansion outside of the GC and refuting its status as endemic to the Gulf. On the other hand, clams from BM were phenotypically different (shell significantly higher) from other Mexican               P. globosa               and               Panopea generosa               specimens, which may account for the confusion in their morphological identification. The ecological niche model for               P. globosa               , integrating ecological and distributional data from the GC, revealed a very low probability (<10%) that this species could successfully occupy BM. Our results and those of others suggest that the Cortes geoduck population in BM may be adapted to specific environmental conditions differing from those experienced by conspecifics inside the Gulf and is likely isolated. This is highly relevant for the management plans of Mexican geoducks.","2013-05","2025-02-21 22:54:35","2025-02-21 22:54:35","2025-02-21 22:54:35","809-816","","3","93","","J. Mar. Biol.

We collected               P. xantusii               occurrence data from crab trapping surveys conducted along the California coast as well as incidental observations by fishermen and SCUBA divers. We then analyzed 10 years of regional offshore temperature patterns using National Data Buoy Center data around the trapping region. We also examined evidence of northern California warm water refugia using sensors monitoring Tomales Bay, Elkhorn Slough, and San Francisco Bay. We found that               P. xantusii               was present in every major estuary north of Monterey Bay and as far north as Tomales Bay and that the documented range expansion was likely due to the unusual oceanographic event that occurred northern California during this time period. Mean offshore temperatures and mean nearshore temperatures during 2014–2016 were about 2°C (one standard deviation) higher than the 2006–2013 mean, with extreme temperatures reaching three standard deviations above the 2006–2013 mean. We suggest that this unusual warm water event permitted survival of dispersing larvae of               P. xantusii               larvae northward via coastal currents, and that the extended warm water period allowed               P.                               xantusii               to complete its development.

The native north‐east Pacific ascidian                 Corella inflata                 Huntsman, 1912, has spread southward and invaded new regions along the North American Pacific coast, a rare example of a marine species moving towards the equator. Here, we document                 C. inflata's                 equatorward movement and potential impact, assess several hypotheses for its spread and consider implications for invasion ecology.

At times, this large, conspicuous solitary ascidian became locally abundant in San Francisco Bay fouling communities, which showed significant shifts in species composition and relative abundance at invaded sites concomitant with                 C. inflata's                 arrival.

By examining in situ behavioral footage of the Humboldt squid,               Dosidicus gigas               , we demonstrate the potential for a deep-living social animal to visually convey and receive large quantities of information by combining complex pigmentation patterning with whole-body luminescence. Our findings reveal a capability for information sharing comparable to advanced forms of animal communication known from well-lit habitats. This may have important implications for ecosystem processes, as information sharing between abundant predators is involved in energy and nutrient transfer throughout the world’s oceans.                        ,                             Visual signals rapidly relay information, facilitating behaviors and ecological interactions that shape ecosystems. However, most known signaling systems can be restricted by low light levels—a pervasive condition in the deep ocean, the largest inhabitable space on the planet. Resident visually cued animals have therefore been hypothesized to have simple signals with limited information-carrying capacity. We used cameras mounted on remotely operated vehicles to study the behavior of the Humboldt squid,               Dosidicus gigas               , in its natural deep-sea habitat. We show that specific pigmentation patterns from its diverse repertoire are selectively displayed during foraging and in social scenarios, and we investigate how these behaviors may be used syntactically for communication. We additionally identify the probable mechanism by which               D. gigas               , and related squids, illuminate these patterns to create visual signals that can be readily perceived in the deep, dark ocean. Numerous small subcutaneous (s.c.) photophores (bioluminescent organs) embedded throughout the muscle tissue make the entire body glow, thereby backlighting the pigmentation patterns. Equipped with a mechanism by which complex information can be rapidly relayed through a visual pathway under low-light conditions, our data suggest that the visual signals displayed by               D. gigas               could share design features with advanced forms of animal communication. Visual signaling by deep-living cephalopods will likely be critical in understanding how, and how much, information can be shared in one of the planet’s most challenging environments for visual communication.","2020-04-14","2025-02-21 22:54:50","2025-02-21 22:54:50","2025-02-21 22:54:50","8524-8531","","15","117","","Proc.

Here, we provide an updated species inventory of nearshore macroalgae, seagrasses, bony and cartilaginous fishes and invertebrates documented inside the Blue Cavern Onshore SMCA. Species richness data were compiled using scuba-based visual surveys conducted in the field, references from the primary and gray literature, museum records, unpublished species lists and online resources. The current checklist consists of 1091 marine species from 18 different taxonomic groups, which represents an ~43% increase in species diversity compared to the value reported previously. These data are indicative of the high biodiversity known from the Southern California Bight (SCB) region. The total number of intertidal and subtidal taxa reported represent approximately 85% and 45% of the documented macroalgae and plants, 41% and 24% invertebrates, and 62% and 20% of fishes from Catalina Island and the SCB, respectively. Among the marine taxa documented, 39 species either have undergone a geographic range shift or were introduced as the result of human activities, while another 4 species are listed as threatened, endangered or critically endangered.

Location                We sampled 15 locations on the coast of California, USA, that span the distributions of the two species of marine mussels and their hybrids.                                         Methods                Mussels were sampled in 2005–08 and analysed at three nuclear gene loci using methods identical to those used in a study a decade earlier in order to document the genetic architecture of this system. Change in the system was determined by comparing the frequency of species‐specific alleles and multi‐locus genotypes over the intervening decade. Climate variation over the same period was examined by comparing the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), upwelling indices and sea surface temperature (SST) during and prior to the study period.                                         Results                Contrary to the general expectations of global warming we show that the highly invasive warm‐water mussel               Mytilus galloprovincialis               and the hybrid zone formed with the endemic species               Mytilus trossulus               has rapidly contracted southwards.               Mytilus galloprovincialis               declined in abundance over the northern third of its geographic range (               c               . 540 km) and has become rare or absent across the northern 200 km of the range it previously colonized during its initial invasion. The distribution of the native species               M. trossulus               has remained unchanged over the same time period.                                         Main conclusions                The large‐scale range shift in the warm‐water invasive species               M. galloprovincialis               and the hybrid zone it forms with               M. trossulus               has been exceptionally rapid and is in the opposite direction to that predicted by the global warming hypotheses. This shift, however, is consistent with decadal climate variation associated with the ENSO and the PDO. Since the biogeography of this system was first described in 1999, the PDO has shifted from a warm phase, dominated by frequent and large El Niño events, to a cold‐phase period, with minimal ENSO activity. Thus recent decadal climate variation can oppose global trends in average temperature and this study illustrates the need to integrate the effects of climate change across multiple time‐scales.","2010-03","2025-02-21 22:59:06","2025-02-21 22:59:06","2025-02-21 22:59:06","423-431","","3","37","","Journal of Biogeography","Historical changes in the distributions of invasive and endemic marine invertebrates are contrary to global warming predictions","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theory on range expansions distinguishes between two different forms: “pulled” and “pushed” waves. Pulled waves occur when the source of the expansion comes from low‐density peripheral populations, while pushed waves occur when recruitment to the expanding edge is supplied by high‐density populations closer to the species' core. How extreme events shape pushed/pulled wave expansion events, as well as trailing‐edge declines/contractions, remains largely unexplored. We examined eco‐evolutionary responses of a marine invertebrate (the owl limpet,               Lottia gigantea               ) that increased in abundance during the 2014–2016 marine heatwaves near the poleward edge of its geographic range in the northeastern Pacific. We used whole‐genome sequencing from 19 populations across >11 degrees of latitude to characterize genomic variation, gene flow, and demographic histories across the species' range. We estimated present‐day dispersal potential and past climatic stability to identify how contemporary and historical seascape features shape genomic characteristics. Consistent with expectations of a pushed wave, we found little genomic differentiation between core and leading‐edge populations, and higher genomic diversity at range edges. A large and well‐mixed population in the northern edge of the species' range is likely a result of ocean current anomalies increasing larval settlement and high‐dispersal potential across biogeographic boundaries. Trailing‐edge populations have higher differentiation from core populations, possibly driven by local selection and limited gene flow, as well as high genomic diversity likely as a result of climatic stability during the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings suggest that extreme events can drive poleward range expansions that carry the adaptive potential of core populations, while also cautioning that trailing‐edge extirpations may threaten unique evolutionary variation. This work highlights the importance of understanding how both trailing and leading edges respond to global change and extreme events.","2024-07","2025-02-21 22:59:19","2025-02-21 22:59:19","2025-02-21 22:59:19","e17414","","7","30","","Global Change Biology","Pushed waves, trailing edges, and extreme events","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/XC9P6HTQ/Pushed waves, trailing edges, and extreme events - Nielsen et al. - 2024.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most benthic macroalgae are inhabited by diverse epifaunal communities but not all organisms may be adapted to live on floating algae. In particular, knowledge about the immediate effects of algal detachment on the associated biota is limited. Herein, we studied the composition of the communities of mobile invertebrates on benthic thalli of               Ascophyllum nodosum               and compared it with detached thalli that had floated for short periods. The community of the mobile invertebrates changed significantly within the first minute after detachment of the algae and showed decreased diversity and a tendency towards reduced abundances in most taxa. However, during the subsequent two hours of floating at the sea surface the species composition did not change further. A comparison of the size-spectra of the gastropod               Littorina obtusata               from attached and detached algae did not reveal differential migratory activity among size-classes of these gastropods. Most of the species encountered in this study are common rafters in coastal and offshore waters, which are well capable of holding onto floating seaweeds. Therefore, our results indicate that the animals actively abandoned the macroalgae immediately after detachment. A benefit of this behaviour may be to avoid increased predation risk in the open water. The fact that individuals remain associated with their algal host after detachment indicates the importance of rafting dispersal for a great variety of phytal species that might lead to range expansion and regional population persistence through metapopulation effects.","2009-03","2025-02-21 22:59:23","2025-02-21 22:59:23","2025-02-21 22:59:23","323-328","","2","89","","J.

Here, we used multivariate ordination to examine temporal patterns in benthic community composition from 4 southern California continental shelf monitoring programs that range in duration from 30 to 50 yr. Temporal changes were compared to variations in temperature, oxygen, and acidification using single-taxon random forest models. Species richness increased over time, coupled with a decline in overall abundance. Continental shelf macrobenthic communities from the 2010s comprised a broader array of feeding guilds and life history strategies than in the 1970s. Changing water temperature was associated with northward shifts in geographic distribution and increases in species abundance, while acidification was associated with southward shifts and declines in abundance of other species. Acidification was also associated with changes in depth distribution of benthic fauna, with shelled molluscs declining in abundance at depths most associated with increasing exposure to acidification. This broad-scale community-level analysis establishes causal hypotheses that set the stage for more targeted studies investigating shifts in abundance or distribution for taxa that appear to be responding to climate change-related disturbances.","2023-11-09","2025-02-21 22:59:24","2025-02-21 22:59:24","2025-02-21 22:59:24","65-88","","","722","","Mar.

However, the potential impacts of climate-driven range shifts are not well understood. In southern California, the predatory whelk               Mexacanthina lugubris               has undergone a northward range shift of more than 100 km in the past four decades. We traced the history of the whelk’s range shift and assessed potential effects using an integrated approach, consisting of field surveys, as well as feeding and thermotolerance experiments. We found that at sites where               Mexacanthina               and native species co-occurred, native whelks distributions peaked lower in the intertidal. In laboratory experiments, we found that the presence of               Mexacanthina               led to reduced growth in native whelks (               Acanthinucella spirata               ). Additionally, the range-shifting whelk was able to tolerate higher temperatures than common native species (               A. spirata               and               Nucella emarginata               ), suggesting further impacts as a result of climate warming. Many species are likely to undergo range shifts as a coping mechanism for changing climatic conditions. However, communities are unlikely to shift as a whole due to species-specific responses. By studying the impacts of range-shifting species, like               Mexacanthina               , we can better understand how climate change will alter existing community structure and composition.","2022-03","2025-02-21 22:59:38","2025-02-21 22:59:38","2025-02-21 22:59:38","749-761","","3","198","","Oecologia","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/VWTG64EP/Dynamic species interactions associated with the r - Wallingford and Sorte - 2022.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One species exhibits a bipolar distribution in the Eastern Pacific and possesses an amphi-South American distribution (               Rostanga pulchra               ). Additionally, six species exhibit an amphi-South American distribution (               Rostanga pulchra               ,               Diaulula punctuolata               ,               Doto uva               ,               Tyrinna evelinae               ,               Tyrinna delicata               , and               Doris fontainii               ), and two species are endemic to Peru (               Corambe mancorensis               and               Felimare sechurana               ). This study provides comprehensive information on biogeographical aspects, geographical distributions, and taxonomic updates within the nudibranch species documented in Peru. Furthermore, we discuss the status of species listed in previous literature that have not been confirmed by collections, referring to them as potentially occurring species.","2023-08-23","2025-02-21 22:59:42","2025-02-21 22:59:42","2025-02-21 22:59:42","117-163","","","1176","","ZK","Peruvian nudibranchs (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Heterobranchia)","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/TLQSYL2W/Peruvian nudibranchs (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Hetero - Grández et al. - 2023.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This island is the most oceanic in the Gulf of California, and information on its rocky reefs is scarce. The present study aimed to generate the first list of conspicuous invertebrate and fish species based on               in situ               observations and to examine the community structure of the shallow rocky reefs of the reserve. In addition, we estimated the ecological indicators of richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, and Pielou evenness to evaluate the conservation status of the biosphere reserve. Data were collected annually from 2007 to 2017 through 2,192 underwater SCUBA transects. A total of 35 species of invertebrates and 73 species of fish were recorded. Most of the species are widely distributed along the eastern Pacific. Overall, 64% of the species found in this study are commercially important, and 11 species have been listed as protected. The abundance of commercially important invertebrate species (i.e., the sea cucumber               Isostichopus fuscus               and the spiny oyster               Spondylus limbatus               ) is decreasing, while commercially important fish species have maintained their abundance with periods of increase. The ecological indicators and the abundance and size of the commercial species indicate that the reserve is in good condition while meeting its conservation objectives.","2021-10-15","2025-02-21 22:59:47","2025-02-21 22:59:47","2025-02-21 22:59:47","177-201","","","1062","","ZK","Marine diversity in the biosphere reserve of the most oceanic island in the Gulf of California","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/QRK6RVMC/Marine diversity in the biosphere reserve of the m - Amador-Castro et al. - 2021.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although most efforts to quantify potential shifts in species' ranges use global climate model (GCM) output, regional climate model (RCM) output may be better suited to predicting shifts by restricted species, particularly in regions with complex topography or other regionally important climate-forcing factors. Using a RCM-based future climate scenario, we found that potential ranges of two California endemic oaks,               Quercus douglasii               and               Quercus lobata               , shrink considerably (to 59% and 54% of modern potential range sizes, respectively) and shift northward. This result is markedly different from that obtained by using a comparable GCM-based scenario, under which these species retain 81% and 73% of their modern potential range sizes, respectively. The difference between RCM- and GCM-based scenarios is due to greater warming and larger precipitation decreases during the growing season predicted by the RCM in these species' potential ranges. Based on the modeled regional climate change, <50% of protected land area currently containing these species is expected to contain them under a future midrange “business-as-usual” path of greenhouse gas emissions.","2005-11-08","2025-02-21 22:59:51","2025-02-21 22:59:51","2025-02-21 22:59:51","16281-16286","","45","102","","Proc.

We found that water temperatures encountered between the third and sixth months of ontogenesis had the strongest negative effect on age. Together with a weaker but significant negative effect of temperatures encountered during early life (first to third months) and later ontogenesis (seventh and eighth months), these temperature parameters (along with other environmental factors) were important in determining whether a given animal had a 1-year life cycle (early maturation and small size) or a 1.5- to 2-year life cycle (delayed maturation and large size).

We report no differentiation for all species across the               ESR               , consistent with panmixia or recent range expansions. A lack of differentiation is notable for               Kiwa tyleri               , which exhibits extremely abbreviated lecithotrophic larval development, suggestive of a very limited dispersal range. Larval lifespans may, however, be extended by low temperature‐induced metabolic rate reduction in the Southern Ocean, muting the impact of dispersal strategy on patterns of population structure.               COI               diversity patterns suggest all species experienced demographic bottlenecks or selective sweeps in the past million years and possibly at different times.

Their divergence, possibility indicative of incipient speciation, along with the absence of the other two species at Kemp, may be the consequence of differing dispersal capabilities across a ~1000 m depth range and/or different selective regimes between the two areas. Estimates of historic and recent limpet gene flow between the               ESR               and Kemp are consistent with predominantly easterly currents and potentially therefore, cross‐axis currents on the               ESR               , with biogeographic implications for the region.","2016-03","2025-02-21 23:00:28","2025-02-21 23:00:28","2025-02-21 23:00:28","1073-1088","","5","25","","Molecular Ecology","Connectivity in the cold","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jordanasevigny/Zotero/storage/AZRMF9VP/Connectivity in the cold the comparative populati - Roterman et al. - 2016.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
